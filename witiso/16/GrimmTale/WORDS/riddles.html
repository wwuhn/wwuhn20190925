<br>
#2 You throw away the outside and cook the inside. Then you eat the outside and 
throw away the inside. What did you eat? <br>
<br>
#3 What goes up and down the stairs without moving? <br>
<br>
#4 What can you catch but not throw? <br>
<br>
#5 I can run but not walk. Wherever I go, thought follows close behind. What am 
I? <br>
<br>
#6 What's black and white and red all over? <br>
<br>
#7 What goes around the world but stays in a corner? <br>
<br>
#8 I have holes in my top and bottom, my left and right, and in the middle. But 
I still hold water. What am I? <br>
<br>
#9 Give me food, and I will live; give me water, and I will die. What am I? <br>
<br>
#10 The man who invented it doesn't want it. The man who bought it doesn't need 
it. The man who needs it doesn't know it. What is it? <br>
<br>
#11 I run over fields and woods all day. Under the bed at night I sit not alone. 
My tongue hangs out, up and to the rear, awaiting to be filled in the morning. 
What am I? <br>
<br>
#12 Throw it off the highest building, and I'll not break. But put me in the 
ocean, and I will. What am I? <br>
<br>
#13 What can run but never walks, has a mouth but never talks, has a head but 
never weeps, has a bed but never sleeps? <br>
<br>
#14 No sooner spoken than broken. What is it? <br>
<br>
#15 A certain crime is punishable if attempted but not punishable if committed. 
What is it? <br>
<br>
#16 You use a knife to slice my head and weep beside me when I am dead. What am 
I? <br>
<br>
#17 I'm the part of the bird that's not in the sky. I can swim in the ocean and 
yet remain dry. What am I? <br>
<br>
#18 I am mother and father, but never birth or nurse. I'm rarely still, but I 
never wander. What am I?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">#19 I went into the woods and got it. I sat down to seek it. I brought it 
home with me because I couldn't find it. What am I? <br>
<br>
#20 I am weightless, but you can see me. Put me in a bucket, and I'll make it 
lighter. What am I? <br>
<br>
#21 I never was, am always to be,<br>
No one ever saw me, nor ever will,<br>
And yet I am the confidence of all<br>
To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#22 I'm light as a feather, yet the strongest man can't hold me for much more 
than a minute. What am I? <br>
<br>
#23 I am the black child of a white father, a wingless bird, flying even to the 
clouds of heaven. I give birth to tears of mourning in pupils that meet me, even 
though there is no cause for grief, and at once on my birth I am dissolved into 
air. What am I? <br>
<br>
#24 Pronounced as one letter,<br>
And written with three,<br>
Two letters there are,<br>
And two only in me.<br>
I'm double, I'm single,<br>
I'm black, blue, and gray,<br>
I'm read from both ends,<br>
And the same either way.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#25 At night they come without being fetched, and by day they are lost without 
being stolen. What are they? <br>
<br>
#26 I'm where yesterday follows today, and tomorrow's in the middle. What am I?
<br>
<br>
#27 From the beginning of eternity<br>
To the end of time and space<br>
To the beginning of every end<br>
And the end of every place.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#28 In a marble hall white as milk<br>
Lined with skin as soft as silk<br>
Within a fountain crystal-clear<br>
A golden apple doth appear.<br>
No doors there are to this stronghold,<br>
Yet thieves break in to steal its gold. <br>
-- Mother Goose <br>
<br>
#29 It is said among my people that some things are improved by death. Tell me, 
what stinks while living but in death smells good? <br>
<br>
#30 All about, but cannot be seen,<br>
Can be captured, cannot be held,<br>
No throat, but can be heard.<br>
What is it? <br>
<br>
#31 If you break me,<br>
I do not stop working.<br>
If you touch me,<br>
I may be snared.<br>
If you lose me,<br>
Nothing will matter.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#32 If a man carried my burden,<br>
He would break his back.<br>
I am not rich,<br>
But I leave silver in my track.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#33 Glittering points that downward thrust,<br>
Sparkling spears that never rust.<br>
What is it? <br>
<br>
#34 Weight in my belly,<br>
Trees on my back,<br>
Nails in my ribs,<br>
Feet do I lack.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#35 Until I am measured,<br>
I am not known.<br>
Yet how you miss me,<br>
When I have flown!<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#36 My life can be measured in hours;<br>
I serve by being devoured.<br>
Thin, I am quick; fat, I am slow.<br>
Wind is my foe.<br>
What am I? </font> </p>

More of me is hidden than is seen.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#38 To unravel me<br>
You need a key.<br>
No key that was made by locksmith's hand,<br>
But a key that only I will understand.<br>
What am I? <br>

#39 I give you a group of three. One is sitting down and will never get up. The 
second eats as much as is given to him, yet is always hungry. The third goes 
away and never returns. What are they? <br>
<br>
#40 Whoever makes it, tells it not. Whoever takes it, knows it not. Whoever 
knows it, wants it not. What is it? <br>
<br>
#41 There is not wind enough to twirl<br>
That one red leaf, nearest of its clan,<br>
Which dances as often as dance it can.<br>
-- Samuel Taylor Coleridge <br>
<br>
#42 What does man love more than life?<br>
Fear more than death or mortal strife?<br>
What do the poor have, what the rich require,<br>
And what contented men desire?<br>
What does the miser spend, the spendthrift save,<br>
And all men carry to their graves? <br>
<br>
#43 Sir, I bear a rhyme excelling<br>
In mystic force and magic spelling<br>
Celestial sprites elucidate<br>
All my own striving can't relate <br>
<br>
#44 What work is it that the faster you work, the longer it is before you're 
done, and the slower you work, the sooner you're finished? <br>
<br>
#45 When I am filled,<br>
I can point the way;<br>
When I am empty,<br>
Nothing moves me.<br>
I have two skins,<br>
One without and one within.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#46 As a whole, I am both safe and secure.<br>
Behead me, and I become a place of meeting.<br>
Behead me again, and I am the partner of ready.<br>
Restore me, and I become the domain of beasts.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#47 I fly, yet I have no wings. I cry, yet I have no eyes. Darkness follows me; 
lower light I never see. <br>
<br>
#48 What walks on four legs in the morning, two at mid-day, and three in the 
evening? <br>
<br>
#49 What is it that, after you take away the whole, some still remains? <br>
<br>
#50 I have hands that wave at you,<br>
Though I never say goodbye.<br>
It's cool for you to be with me,<br>
Especially when I say, &quot;HI.&quot;<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#51 You can have me but cannot hold me;<br>
Gain me and quickly lose me.<br>
If treated with care I can be great,<br>
And if betrayed I will break.<br>
What am I? <br>
<br>
#52 My tines be long,<br>
My tines be short<br>
My tines end ere<br>
My first report.<br>
What am I? <br>

My lightning comes before the clouds;<br>
My rain dries all the land it touches.<br>
