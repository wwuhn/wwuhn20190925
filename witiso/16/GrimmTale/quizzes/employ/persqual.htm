<P>Personal qualities are personal characteristics of an individual. They are what make up one's personality. They help a person get along in a new situation. For example, dependability and patience are qualities that employers would like a good worker to have. Other qualities employers value are: honesty, assertiveness, flexibility, problem solving, friendliness, intelligence, leadership, enthusiasm, and a good sense of humor.
<P>Most employers want people who are dependable and who get along with others. Though skills are important, an employer will select new employees based on their personal qualities as well. <HR>
