<P>A resume is an individualized, written summary of your personal, educational and experience qualifications. It is designed to present <I>you</I> as a prospective employee. Not everyone needs a resume. However, if you are looking for a professional, technical, administrative, or managerial job, you will need a resume. Applications for many clerical and sales positions also require a resume.
<P>A resume is like a written sales presentation. It alone will not get you a job. However, an effective resume creates a favorable impression of you while presenting your abilities and experience. Your resume can be used as a response to an ad. It can also be used as a letter of introduction for an interview. It is a fact sheet that tells a prospective employer that you are a desirable prospective employee. <HR>
