<P>An interview is a meeting between an employer and an applicant to talk about a job. A job interview is your opportunity to present your skills to an employer in person. During the interview, an employer judges your qualifications, appearance, and general fitness for the job opening. The interview is your opportunity to convince the employer that you are right for the job.
<P>The interview also gives you a chance to evaluate the job, the employer, and the company. The interview helps you decide if the job meets your career needs and interests.
<P>It is very important to prepare for a job interview. If you prepare well, the interviewer will know that you are organized and that you are really interested in the job. If you learn as much as you can about the job and the company before the interview, and if you are careful about your appearance, then you will make a good impression. If you practice the interview questions that managers usually ask, then you will feel confident when you speak. <HR>
