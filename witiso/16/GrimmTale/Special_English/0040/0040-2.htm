<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is Steve Ember.  And this is Shirley Griffith with the VOA Special 
English program, Explorations.  Today we present the second of our two 
programs about the history of the English Language. <br><br>
        
  Last week, we told how the English language developed as a result of 
several invasions of Britain.  The first involved three tribes called the 
Angles, the Jutes and the Saxons.  A mix of their languages produced a 
language called Anglo-Saxon, or Old English.  It sounded very much like 
German.  Only a few words <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#remain">remained</a> from the Celts who had lived in Britain <br><br>

  Two more invasions added words to Old English.  The Vikings of Denmark, 
Norway and Sweden arrived in Britain more than one-thousand years ago.  
The next invasion took place in the year Ten-Sixty-Six.  French forces 
from Normandy were led by a man known as William the Conqueror. <br><br>

  The Norman rulers added many words to English.  The words <i>parliament,</i> 
<i>jury, justice,</i> and others that 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#deal with">deal with</a> law come from the Norman 
rulers. <br><br>
  
  <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#over time">Over time</a>, the different languages 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#combine">combined</a> to 
<a href="0040-4.htm#result in">result in</a> what English 
experts call Middle English.  While Middle English still sounds
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#similar">similar to</a> 
German, it also begins to sound like Modern English. <br><br>

  Here Warren Scheer reads the very beginning of Geoffrey Chaucer's great 
poem, <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> as it was written in Middle English.   <br><br>
  
  Chaucer wrote that poem in the late Thirteen-Hundreds.  It was written in 
the language of the people.  The rulers of Britain at that time still 
spoke the Norman French they brought with them in Ten-Sixty-Six.  <br><br>

  The kings of Britain did not speak the language of the people until the 
early Fourteen-Hundreds.  Slowly, Norman French was used 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#less and less">less and less</a> 
until it disappeared.  <br><br>
  
  The English language was strongly 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#influence">influenced</a> by an event that took place 
one-thousand-four-hundred years ago.  In the year Five-Ninety-Seven, the 
Roman <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Catholic">Catholic</a> Church began its attempt to make 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Christianity">Christianity</a> the religion 
of Britain.   <br><br>

  The language of the Catholic Church was Latin.  Latin was not spoken as a 
language in any country at that time.  But it was still used by some 
people.  <br><br>

  Latin made it possible for a church member from Rome to speak to a church 
member from Britain.  Educated people from different countries could 
communicate using Latin. <br><br>

  Latin had a great affect on the English language.  Here are a few 
examples.  The Latin word <i><a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#discus">discus</a></i> became several words in English 
including <i>disk, dish,</i> and <i>desk.</i>  The Latin word <i>
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#quietus">quietus</a></i>
became the English word <i>quiet.</i>  Some English names of plants such as 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#ginger">ginger</a> and trees such as cedar come from Latin. So do some medical words 
such as cancer. <br><br>

  English is a little like a living thing that continues to grow.  English 
began to grow more quickly when 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#William Caxton">William Caxton</a> returned to Britain in the 
year Fourteen-Seventy-Six.  He had been in Holland and other areas of 
Europe where he had learned printing.  He returned to Britain with the 
first <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#press">printing press</a>. <br><br>

  The printing press made it possible for almost anyone to buy a book.  It 
helped <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#spread">spread</a> education and the English language. <br><br>
  
  Slowly, during the Fifteen-Hundreds English became the modern language we 
would recognize.  English speakers today would be able to communicate with 
English speakers in the last part of the Sixteenth Century.  <br><br>

  It was during this time period that the greatest writer in English 
produced his work.  His name was William 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>.  His plays continue 
to be printed, acted in theaters, and seen in 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#motion picture">motion pictures</a> almost 
four-hundred years after his death. <br><br>
  
  Experts say that Shakespeare's work was written to be performed on the 
stage, not to be read.  Yet very sound of his words can produce word 
pictures, and provide feelings of anger, fear, and 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#laughter">laughter</a>.  <br><br>

  Shakespeare's famous play <i>
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i> is so sad that people cry 
when they see this famous story.  The story of the power hungry King 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Richard the Third">Richard the Third</a> is another very popular play by Shakespeare.  Listen as Shep O'Neal reads the beginning, of <i>Richard the Third.</i> <br><br>
  
  The development of the English language took a 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#giant">giant</a> step just nine years 
before the death of William Shakespeare.  Three small British ships 
crossed the Atlantic Ocean in Sixteen-Oh-Seven.  They landed in an area 
that would later become the southern American state of Virginia.  They 
began the first of several British colonies.  The name of the first small
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#colony">colony</a> was 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Jamestown">Jamestown</a>.  <br><br>

  In time, people in these new colonies began to call areas of their new 
land by words borrowed from the native people they found living there.  
For example, many of the great rivers in the United States are taken from 
American Indian words.  The <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, the 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, the 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Missouri">Missouri</a> are 
examples.   <br><br>

  Other Native American words included <i>
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#moccasin">moccasin</a>,</i> the kind of shoe made 
of animal skin that Indians wore on their feet. This borrowing or adding of 
foreign words to English was a way of 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#expand">expanding</a> the language.  The names 
of three days of the week are good examples of this.  The people from 
Northern Europe honored three gods with a special day each week.  The gods 
were <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Odin">Odin</a>, 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Thor">Thor</a> and
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Freya">Freya</a>.  Odin's-day became Wednesday in English, 
Thor's-day became Thursday and Freya's-day became Friday.   <br><br>
  
  Britain had other colonies in Africa, Asia, 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#the Caribbean">the Caribbean</a>, and India.  
The English language also became part of these colonies.  These colonies 
are now independent, but English still is one of the languages spoken.  
And the English language grew as words from the native languages were added. 
For example, the word <i><a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#shampoo">shampoo</a></i> for soap for the hair came from India.  
<i>Banana</i> is believed to be from Africa.   <br><br>

  Experts cannot explain many English words.  For hundreds of years, a dog 
was called a <i><a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#hound">hound</a>.</i>  The word is still used but not as commonly as the 
word <i>dog.</i>  Experts do not know where the word <i>dog</i> came from or when.  
English speakers just started using it.  Other words whose 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#origin">origins</a> are 
unknown include <i>fun,</i> <i>bad,</i> and <i>big.</i> <br><br>

  English speakers also continue to invent new words by linking old words 
together.  A good example is the words <i>motor</i> and <i>hotel.</i>  Many years 
ago some one linked them together into the word <i>
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#motel">motel</a>.</i>  A motel is a 
small hotel near a road where people travelling in cars can stay for the 
night.  Other words come from the first letters of names of groups or 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#device">devices</a>.
A device to find objects that cannot be seen called Radio Detecting and 
Ranging became <i><a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Radar">Radar</a>.</i>  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is usually 
called <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#NATO">NATO</a>. <br><br>

  Experts say that English has more words that explain the same thing that 
any other language.  For example, the words <i>large,</i> <i>huge,</i> <i>vast,</i> 
<i>massive,</i> and <i>enormous</i> all mean something really <i>big.</i>  <br><br>
  
  People often ask how many words there are in the English language.  Well, 
no one really knows.  The <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Oxford">Oxford</a> English Dictionary lists about 
six-hundred-fifteen-thousand words.  Yet the many scientific words not in 
the dictionary could increase the number to almost one-million. <br><br>

  And experts are never really sure how to count English words.  For 
example, the word <i><a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#mouse">mouse</a>.</i>  A mouse is a small 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm">creature</a> from the 
<a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#rodent">rodent</a> 
family.  But <i>mouse</i> has another very different meaning.  A <i>mouse</i> 
is also a <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#hand-held">hand-held</a> device used to help control a computer.  If you are 
counting words do you count <i>mouse</i> two times?  <br><br>
  
  Visitors to the Voice of America hear people speaking more than fifty 
different languages.  Most <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#broadcaster">broadcasters</a> at VOA come from countries where 
these languages are spoken.  International organizations such as VOA would 
find it impossible to <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#operate">operate</a> without a second language all the people 
speak. <br><br>

  The language that <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#permit">permits</a> VOA to work is English.  It is not unusual to 
see someone from the <a target="bottom" href="0040-4.htm#Chinese Service">Chinese Service</a> talking to someone from the
<a href="0040-4.htm">Arabic 
Service</a>, both speaking English. English is becoming the common language of 
millions of people worldwide, helping speakers of many different languages 
communicate. <br><br>
