<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Edgar Poe was born in Eighteen-Oh-Nine. His parents were actors. At that time, 
actors were not <a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#accept">accepted</a> by

left the family. He was two years old when his mother died. He was taken into 
the home of a wealthy businessman, John Allan. He then 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#receive">received</a> his new name -- 
Edgar Allan Poe. John Allan never 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#officially">officially</a> made Edgar his son.
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#in fact">In fact</a>, he

Virginia. He was a good student. But he liked to drink 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#alcohol">alcohol</a> and 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#play card games">play card 
games</a> for money. Edgar was not a good player. He 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#lose money">lost money</a> he did not have. 
John Allan refused to pay Edgar's <a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#gambling">gambling</a> losses. So, Edgar left the 
university. He began working as a writer and editor for monthly magazines. <br>
<br>
Edgar Allan Poe worked hard. He became a successful 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#editor">editor</a>. Yet he was not 
well-paid or well-known. His life was difficult. He was poor, and he was 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#trouble">troubled</a> by sicknesses of the body and mind. Poe suffered from 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#depression">depression</a>. He 
feared he was <a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#insane">insane</a>. He drank alcohol to

<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#have an effect/influence on sb./sth.">had a 
very bad effect on him</a>. <br>
<br>
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#at the age of">At the age of</a> twenty-seven, he married Virginia Clemm. She was the daughter of 
his father's sister. She was only thirteen years old. For a time, it seemed that 
Poe would find some happiness. But his wife was sick for most of their marriage. 
She died in Eighteen-Forty-Seven. Poe died two years later, at the age of forty. 
He was found dead in Baltimore after days of heavy drinking. <br>
<br>
Through all his crises, Edgar Allan Poe produced many stories, poems, and works 
of criticism. Some of his stories won prizes. Yet he did not become famous until 
Eighteen-Forty-Five. That was when his poem &quot;The Raven&quot; was published. 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#there is no question that">There is 
no question that</a> Poe suffered from 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#emotional">emotional problems</a> in his life. One critic 
said Poe's spirit <a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#tear">was torn</a>. He said Poe's stories were often about his own 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#divided nature">divided nature</a>. Each person in the story showed a different side of the writer. 
There is a question, however, about Poe's importance. Some critics say he was 
one of America's best writers. Others 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#disagree">disagree</a>. <br>
<br>
Critic Vincent Buranelli says Poe <a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#discover">discovered</a> a new artistic universe. It is a 
universe of dreams. It is a place where the line between reality and unreality 
is extremely thin. Even those who praise Poe agree that there are many 
difficulties in his work. These difficulties 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#place">place</a> Poe's writing outside the 
main body of American literature. Most American writing is 
<a target="bottom" href="0032-4.htm#realistic">realistic</a>. Poe's 
interests and way of writing were not realistic at all. Poe's work has been 
praised most in France. He had a great influence on many French writers, 
including the poets Charles-Pierre Baudelaire and Stephane Mallarme. <br>
