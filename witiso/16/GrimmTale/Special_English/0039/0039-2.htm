<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is Steve Ember.  And this is Shirley Griffith with the VOA Special 
English program Explorations.  Today we present the first of two programs 
about the history of the English Language.    <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  More people are trying to learn English than any other language in the 
world.  English is the language of 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#political negotiations">political negotiations</a> and 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#international business">international 
business</a>. It has become the international language of science and 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#medicine">medicine</a>.
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#International treaties say...">International treaties say</a> passenger airplane 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#pilot">pilots</a> must speak English.   <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  English is the major foreign language taught in most schools in South 
America and Europe.  School children in the 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Philippines">Philippines</a> and Japan begin 
learning English at an early age.   English is the
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#official language">official language</a> of 
more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United 
States, Australia, and South Africa. <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  In countries where many different languages are spoken, English is often 
used as an official language to help people 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#communicate">communicate</a>.  India is good 
example.  English is the common language in this country where at least 
twenty-four languages are spoken by more than one-million people. <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  Where did the English language come from?  Why has it become so popular?  
To answer these questions we must 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#travel back in time">travel back in time</a> about five-thousand 
years to an area north of the Black Sea in southeastern Europe.  <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Experts say the people in that area spoke a language called 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Proto-Indo-European">Proto-Indo-European</a>.  That language is no longer spoken.  Researchers do not really 
know what it sounded like.   Yet, Proto-Indo-European is believed to be the
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#ancestor">ancestor</a> of most European languages.  These include the languages that 
became <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#ancient">ancient</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Greek">Greek</a>, ancient German and the ancient 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Latin">Latin</a>. <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Latin disappeared as a spoken language.  Yet it left behind three great 
languages that became modern Spanish, French and 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Italian">Italian</a>.  Ancient German 
became <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Dutch">Dutch</a>,
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Danish">Danish</a>, German, 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Norwegian">Norwegian</a>, 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Swedish">Swedish</a> and one of the languages 
that developed into English. <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  The English language is a result of the 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#invasion">invasions</a> of the island of Britain 
over many hundreds of years.  The <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#invader">invaders</a> lived along the northern coast 
of Europe. <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The first invasions were by a people called 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Angle">Angles</a> about one-thousand-five 
hundred years ago.  The Angles were a German 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#tribe">tribe</a> who 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#cross">crossed</a> the 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#English Channel">English 
Channel</a>.  Later two more groups crossed to Britain.  They were the 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Saxon">Saxons</a> 
and the <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Jute">Jutes</a>.   <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  These groups found a people called the 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Celt">Celts</a>, who had lived in Britain for 
many thousands of years.  The Celts and the invaders fought.  After 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#a while">a while</a>, 
most of the Celts were killed, or made slaves.  Some escaped to live in the 
area that became Wales.  Through the years, the Saxons, Angles and Jutes 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#mix">mixed</a> their different languages.  The result is what is called
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> 
or Old English.  <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Old English is <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#extremely">extremely</a> difficult to understand.  Only a few experts can 
read this earliest form of English.   <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  Several written <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#work">works</a> have
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#survive">survived</a> from the Old English period.  Perhaps 
the most famous is called <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Beowulf">Beowulf</a>.  It is the oldest known English poem.  
Experts say it was written in Britain more than one-thousand years ago.  
The name of the person who wrote it is not known. <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Beowulf is the story of a great king who fought against 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#monster">monsters</a>.  He was 
a good king, well liked by his people.  A new book by 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Seamus Heaney">Seamus Heaney</a> tells 
this ancient story in modern English.  <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Listen as Warren Scheer reads the beginning of this ancient story. <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  The next great invasion of Britain came from the far north beginning about 
one-thousand-one-hundred years ago.  Fierce people called 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Viking">Vikings</a> 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#raid">raided</a> 
the coast areas of Britain.  The Vikings came from Denmark, Norway and 
other northern countries.  They were looking to
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#capture">capture</a> trade goods and 
slaves and take away anything of value.   <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  In some areas, the Vikings became so powerful they built 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#temporary">temporary</a> 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#base">bases</a>.  
These temporary bases sometimes became 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#permanent">permanent</a>.  Later, many Vikings stayed 
in Britain.  Many English words used today come from these ancient Vikings.  
Words like "sky,"  "leg," "<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#skull">skull</a>," "egg," "crawl,"  "lift" and 
"take" are from the old languages of the far northern countries.  <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  The next invasion of Britain took place more than nine-hundred years ago, 
in Ten-Sixty-Six.  History experts call this invasion the 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Norman">Norman</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#conquest">Conquest</a>. 
William the <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#conqueror">Conqueror</a> led it.    <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The Normans were a French speaking people from 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Normandy">Normandy</a> in the north of 
France.  They became the new <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#ruler">rulers</a> of Britain.  These new rulers spoke 
only French for several hundred years.  It was the most important language 
in the world at that time.  It was the language of
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#educated">educated</a> people.  But 
the common people of Britain still spoke Old English.  <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  Old English took many words from the Norman French.  Some of these include 
"<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#damage">damage</a>," "prison," and "marriage."  Most English words that describe 
law and government come from Norman French.  Words such as "<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#jury">jury</a>,"
"<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#parliament">parliament</a>," and "<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#justice">justice</a>." <br><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The French language used by the Norman rulers greatly changed the way 
English was spoken by eight hundred years ago.  English became what 
language experts call Middle English.  As time passed, the 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#ruling">ruling</a> Normans 
no longer spoke true French.  Their language had become a mix of French 
and Middle English.    <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  Middle English sounds like modern English.  But it is very difficult to 
understand now.  Many written works from this period have 
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#survive">survived</a>.  
Perhaps the most famous was written by
<a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#Geoffrey Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>, a poet who lived 
in London and died there in fourteen-hundred.  Chaucer's most famous work 
is <i><a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#The Canterbury Tales">The Canterbury Tales</a>,</i> written more than six-hundred years ago.   <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  The Canterbury Tales is a collection of poems about different people 
traveling to the town of Canterbury.   Listen for a few moments as Warren 
Scheer reads the beginning of Chaucer's famous Canterbury Tales.  <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  Now listen as Mr. Scheer reads the same sentences again, but this time 
in Modern English.  <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  English language experts say Geoffrey Chaucer was the first important 
writer to use the English language.  They also agree that Chaucer's great 
Middle English poem gives us a clear picture of the people of his time.  <br><br>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
  Some of the people described in The Canterbury Tales are wise and brave, 
some are stupid and foolish.  Some believe they are extremely important.  
Some are very nice, others are <a target="bottom" href="0039-4.htm#mean">mean</a>.  But they all still seem real.   <br><br>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
The history of the English language continues as Middle English becomes 
Modern English, which is spoken today.  That will be our story next time.  <br><br>
