<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#unofficial">unofficial</a> holiday that 
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#celebrate">celebrates</a> the
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#frightening">frightening</a> and 
strange. We celebrate with a report about a Nineteenth-century American writer. 
His stories were some of the most frightening and strange ever written. I'm 
Shirley Griffith. <br>
<br>
And I'm Doug Johnson. The writer 
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> is our report today on the VOA 
Special English program THIS IS AMERICA. <br>

Halloween is mostly a holiday for children, who like to be 
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#frightened">frightened</a>. Yet many 
grown people <a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#observe">observe</a> Halloween, too. Those who love the writings of Edgar Allan 
Poe think Halloween is the best time of year to celebrate them. Poe is most 
famous for his stories and poems of strangeness, mystery, and terror. He wrote 
about people <a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#bury">buried</a> while still alive. About 
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#insanity">insanity</a> and death. About dreams 
that become real...or reality that seems like a dream. <br>
<br>
Edgar Allan Poe died in the city of Baltimore in Eighteen-Forty-Nine. Now, in 
that city, an unusual party <a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#take place">takes place</a> every Halloween. In the dark of night, 
visitors go to the church ground where Poe is buried. Everything is quiet. Then 
a voice <a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#call out">calls out</a>. It is Poe! (pause) No, it is just an actor, reading Poe's 
work. <br>
<br>
Reading stories was one of the most important forms of enjoyment in Edgar Allan 
Poe's time. Poe created many of these &quot;short&quot; stories. They appeared in 
different publications. <a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#horror stories">Horror stories</a> already were popular when Poe began 
writing. Critics say he wrote the perfect horror story. Poe also wrote 
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#detective stories">detective 
stories</a>. These were mysteries about crimes, such as murder. The mysteries are 
solved by an <a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#investigator">investigator</a> called a detective. He or she is able to find 
important, hidden meanings in facts. The horror and detective stories Poe 
created remain extremely popular in books and movies. <br>
<br>
Edgar Allan Poe's work is not easy to read. His language is difficult to 
understand today. And most of his writing 
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#describe">describes</a> very unpleasant situations 
and events. His story &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum,&quot; for example, is about the 
mental <a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#torture">torture</a> of a prisoner. Each time the prisoner saves himself from death, a 
new and more horrible form of death threatens him. Another story is &quot;The Masque 
of the Red Death.&quot; In it, a terrible disease -- the Red Death -- has killed half 
the population of a country. The ruler of the country
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#shut">shuts</a> his castle against 
the disease. He and his wealthy friends are inside. They 
<a target="bottom" href="0031-4.htm#pass the time by doing sth">pass the time by having 
parties</a>. They believe the Red Death will not find them. But it does. <br>
