<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The disease <a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#AIDS">AIDS</a> was first reported in the United States 20 years ago. By the 
end of last year, more than 774,000 Americans had AIDS. More than 448,000 
Americans had died from the disease. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Recently, American health officials 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#release">released</a> new information on the problem 
of AIDS in the United States. Their reports suggest that the number of Americans 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#infect">infected with</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#HIV">HIV</a>, the 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#virus">virus</a> that causes AIDS, has
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#remain">remained the same</a> in the past 
few years. The health officials warned of a possible increase in the number of
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#infection">infections</a> unless more is done to prevent the 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#spread">spread of AIDS</a>. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Officials with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#announce">announced</a> the findings. The 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#CDC">CDC</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#official">officials</a> said the number of AIDS cases and 
deaths dropped sharply during the Nineteen-Nineties. But they said 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#both numbers">both numbers</a> 
have changed little since 1998. The CDC said about 40,000 people became newly
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#infect">infected with</a> HIV in each of the past two years. In each of those years, about 
16,000 Americans died from AIDS infections. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Helene Gayle is the <a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#director">director</a> for 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#prevention">AIDS prevention</a> with the CDC. Dr. Gayle 
proposed <a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#steps">steps</a> to reduce the number of AIDS infections and deaths. They include 
expanding testing for the AIDS virus, improving medical care for patients and 
finding new treatments for patients in whom the virus becomes 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#resistant (to...)">resistant to</a> 
medicines. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#evidence">Evidence</a> from several American cities 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#suggest">suggests</a> that AIDS remains a serious 
problem among some groups. One study was done in 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#Seattle">Seattle</a>, 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#Washington">Washington</a>. It studied 
men who had <a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#sexual">sexual relations</a> with men. It found that the rate of unprotected sex 
among the <a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#homosexual">homosexual</a> men increased between 1994 and 2000. American experts 
strongly <a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#suggest the use of..">suggest the use</a> of
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#condom">condoms</a> to protect against the spread of AIDS. The 
same study found that the number of homosexual men who had six or more sex 
partners in the past year has increased. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Another study examined mostly poor black women in 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, 
<a target="bottom" href="0018-4.htm#Georgia">Georgia</a>. That 
study found that 60 percent of the women did not know if their sex partner was 
infected with the AIDS virus. It also found that almost half the women 
questioned said their partner had not worn a condom. </font> </p>
