    Today is Presidents' Day in the United States. It is the day to honor all
American presidents. I'm Shirley Grifith. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     And I'm Rich Kleinfeldt. We tell about one of America's greatest presidents, 
Abraham Lincoln, on our report today on the VOA Special English program THIS IS 
AMERICA. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Americans celebrate Presidents' Day each year on the third Monday of February. 
But they did not always do so. They used to 
<a href="0037-4.htm#observe the birthday">observe the birthdays of</a> two of the 
greatest American presidents, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Both men 
were born in the month of February. Abraham Lincoln's birthday is February twelfth. 
George Washington's is February twenty-second. <br>
<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In Nineteen-Seventy-One,  Congress <a href="0037-4.htm#approve a law">approved a law</a> that affected some 
national holidays. It <a href="0037-4.htm#change X to Y">changed the official celebration of the holiday to the Monday</a>
<a href="0037-4.htm#closest to the real date">closest to the real date</a>. The birthdays of the two Presidents were celebrated on one day 
-- the third Monday in February. Later, Congress said the holiday would 
<a href="0037-4.htm#honor">honor</a> all 
American presidents. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth American president. He is considered one of 
the greatest leaders of all time. Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky in Eighteen-Oh-
Nine. He grew up in Illinois. His family was poor and had no education. Abraham Lincoln 
taught himself what he needed to know. He became a lawyer. He served in the Illinois 
state legislature and in the United States Congress. In Eighteen-Sixty, he was elected 
to the country's highest office. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     President Lincoln led the United States during the Civil War between the northern 
and southern states. This was the most serious crisis in American history. President 
Lincoln helped end slavery in the nation. And he helped 
<a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#keep the American union from...">keep the American union 
from</a> <a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#split apart">splitting apart</a> during the war. President Lincoln believed that he proved to the 
world that democracy can be a lasting form of government. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In Eighteen-Sixty-Three, President Lincoln gave what became his most famous 
speech. Union armies of the north had won two great victories that year. They 
defeated the Confederate armies of the south at Vicksburg, Mississippi and at 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Ceremonies were held to honor the dead soldiers at a burial 
place on the Gettysburg battlefield. <br>
<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     President Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg for only about two minutes. But his speech 
has never been forgotten. Historians say the speech 
<a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#define X as Y">defined Americans as</a> a people who 
<a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#believe in...">believed in</a> freedom, democracy and equality.<br>
<br> 
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     Abraham Lincoln wrote some of the most memorable words in American history. 
He was murdered a few days after the Civil War ended, in Eighteen-Sixty-Five. Yet 
his words live on. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In Nineteen-Forty-Two, orchestra conductor Andre Kostelanitz asked composer 
Aaron Copland to write a piece of music about Abraham Lincoln. Copland was one of the 
best modern American composers. He wrote many kinds of music. His music told stories 
about the United States. <br>
<br>
     Aaron Copland wrote &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot; to honor the president. Copland's music 
included parts of American <a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#folk songs">folk songs</a> and songs popular during the Civil War. Here is 
the Seattle Symphony playing part of &quot;Lincoln Portrait.&quot; <br>
<i>((TAPE CUT ONE: LINCOLN PORTRAIT)) <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Aaron Copland added words from President Lincoln's speeches and letters to his 
&quot;Lincoln Portrait.&quot; It has been performed many times in the United States. Many famous 
people have read the words. To celebrate Presidents' Day, here is actor James Earl 
Jones reading part of Aaron Copland's &quot;Lincoln Portrait.&quot; <br>

<br>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</i>&quot;Fellow 
citizens, we cannot escape history.&quot; That is what he said, That is what Abraham Lincoln 
said: &quot;<a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#fellow citizen">Fellow citizens</a>, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this 
administration will be remembered 
<a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#in spite of ourselves">in spite of ourselves</a>. No personal

generation. We - even we here - hold the power and bear the responsibility&quot;´ Lincoln 
was a quiet man. Abe Lincoln was a quiet and melancholy man. But, when he spoke of 
Democracy, this is what he said: <br>
<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He said: &quot;As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my 
idea of Democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no 
democracy.&quot; <br>
<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth President of these United States, is everlasting in 
the memory of his countrymen, for on the battleground at Gettysburg this is what he said: 
    He said: &quot;that from these honored dead we take increased  devotion to that 
cause for which they 
<a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#give full/short measure">gave the last full measure</a> of devotion: that we here highly

that these dead shall not have died <a target="bottom" href="0037-4.htm#in vain">in vain</a>; and that this nation under God, shall have a 
new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the 
people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
