<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#carrot"><font size="4">Carrots</font></a><font size="4"> are grown on farms and in small family gardens throughout the world.
They are easy to raise and easy to harvest.
They have a pleasing taste.
And, they contain a lot of <a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#carotene">carotene</a> which the body 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#change into">changes into</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#Vitamin">Vitamin</a> A. </font></font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When people think about carrots, they usually create a 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#mental">mental</a> picture of a long, thin, orange-colored vegetable.
But, carrots come
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#in many different sizes and shapes">in many different sizes and shapes</a>.
And not all carrots are orange. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For example, <a name="pm"></a>Paris Market<a target="bottom1" href="#*">*</a> carrots are about five centimeters around.
Imperator<a target="bottom1" href="#*">*</a> carrots are thin and about twenty-five centimeters long.
And Belgian White<a target="bottom1" href="#*">*</a> carrots are white. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For the best results, carrots should be grown in sandy soil that does not 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#hold water">hold water</a> for a long time.
The soil also should have no rocks. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To prepare your carrot garden, <a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#dig up">dig up</a> the soil, loosen it, and turn it over.
Then, mix some dead plant material or animal waste.
Do not add any additional chemical 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#fertilizer">fertilizers</a>. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Weather, soil condition, and <a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#age">age</a> affect the way carrots taste.
Experts say warm days, cool nights, and a 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#medium">medium</a> soil temperature are the best conditions for growing 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#great tasting carrots">great tasting carrots</a>.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Carrots need time to develop their full sugar content.
This gives them their taste.
If they are <a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#harvest">harvested</a> too early they will not have enough sugar.
However, carrots become wood-like and loose their 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#sweetness">sweetness</a> if you wait too long to remove them from the ground.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The best way to <a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#judge">judge</a> if a carrot is ready to be harvested is by its color.
Usually, the brighter the color, the better the taste. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Most people do not know that carrots can be grown during the winter months.
If the winter is not cold enough to freeze the ground, you can grow and harvest carrots the same way as you do during the summer months.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">If the ground does <a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#freeze">freeze</a> in your part of the world, simply 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#cover with">cover</a> your carrot garden with a thick layer of leaves or
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#straw">straw</a>.
This will <a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#prevent ´from">prevent</a> the ground from freezing.
You can remove the ground cover and harvest the carrots as they are needed.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Carrots are prepared and eaten many different ways.
They are cut in thin pieces and added to other vegetables.
They are cooked by themselves or added to meat in 
<a target="bottom" href="0008-4.htm#stew">stews</a>.
Or, they are washed, and eaten just as they come out of the ground. </font>
