<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Poe's best-known poem is the &quot;The Raven.&quot; Some _______ love it. They say it is 
like _______. Others hate it. They say it sounds _______ and unnatural -- like bad 
music. &quot;The Raven&quot; is _______ a man whose great love, Lenore, has died. She is 
_______ forever. But the man cannot accept that all _______ is gone. He sits 
alone among his _______ late at night. He hears a _______ at the window. Here is the 
beginning of the _______: <br>
<br>
ANNOUNCER: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I _______, weak and weary Over 
many a quaint and _______ volume of forgotten lore -- While I nodded, _______ napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of 
_______ gently rapping, rapping at 
my chamber _______. &quot;Tis some visitor, I muttered, &quot;tapping at my 
_______ door -- 
Only this and nothing more.&quot; <br>
<br>
The man _______ out the window and sees only _______ . <br>
<br>
ANNOUNCER: Deep into that darkness peering, _______ I stood there wondering, 
fearing, Doubting, _______ dreams no mortal ever dared to dream _______: But the 
silence was unbroken, and the _______ gave no token, And the only _______ there 
spoken was the whispered word, &quot;Lenore?&quot; _______ I whispered, and an echo murmured 
back the _______, &quot;Lenore!&quot; Merely this and nothing more. <br>
<br>
But _______ is something at the window. It is a _______ black bird -- a raven. It 
comes into the _______ like the spirit of death and _______. The raven can 
speak just one word: 'nevermore' -- _______ 'never again'. We know the raven 
will never _______ the man's room. <br>
<br>
ANNOUNCER: But the Raven, _______ lonely on the placid bust, spoke only _______ one 
word, as if his soul in that _______ word he did outpour. Nothing farther than he 
_______ -- not a feather then he fluttered -- Till I _______ more than 
muttered, &quot;Other friends have _______ before -- On the morrow he will 
_______ me, as 
my Hopes have flown _______ .&quot; Then the bird said, &quot;Nevermore.&quot; <br>
