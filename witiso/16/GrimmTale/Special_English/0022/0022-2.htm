<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is the VOA Special English ENVIRONMENT REPORT.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A new report says the <a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#growing population">growing population</a> around the world is harming the 
environment. More people are using more of the Earth's natural resources than
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#ever before">ever before</a>. Experts say poor people around the world will suffer most in the 
future unless environmental damage is stopped. They say more should be done to 
balance human and environmental needs. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United Nations Population Fund
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#be responsible for">is responsible for</a> studying population 
growth. It <a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#release">released</a> the report about the subject earlier this month. The report 
is called the State of the World Population, Two-Thousand-One. It examines the
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#link">links</a> among environmental conditions, population growth and efforts to help poor 
people in developing countries. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The world's population is now more than six-thousand-million people. That 
number has increased by one-hundred percent since Nineteen-Sixty. The population 
is expected to increase to more than nine-thousand-million by the year 
Two-Thousand-Fifty. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The report says about two-thousand-million people lack food security. Water 
supplies and agricultural lands are heavily used.
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#In fifty years">In fifty years</a>, experts say 
more than four-thousand million people will be living in countries that can not
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm">meet people's daily needs</a>. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The report says all of the expected growth in world population will
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#take place">take 
place</a> in developing countries. The forty-nine least developed countries are 
expected to increase by almost two-hundred percent in fifty years. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Yet, the U-N <a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#agency">agency</a> says people in the richest countries use much more of the 
world's resources than people in developing countries. It says a child born 
today in the United States, France or Japan will
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#do harm to">do more harm to</a> the environment 
during his lifetime than as many as fifty children born in developing countries.

</p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The U-N Population Fund says international policies need to be<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#put ´ into effect"> put into 
effect</a> to improve poor conditions, increase social development and
<a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm#ease">ease pressure 
on</a> the environment. It also says women need more control over their lives. It 
says <a target="bottom" href="0022-4.htm">empowering</a> women would

growth. The U-N Population Fund says these measures would help improve the
