<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is Bill White with the VOA Special English SCIENCE REPORT.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A new report <a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#examine">examines</a> the problem of tooth and 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#disease">gum disease</a> in the United 
States. It found that many Americans are not doing enough to care for their 
teeth. The report says the biggest problems are the 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#lack">lack</a> of 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#dental health care">dental health care</a> 
for all Americans and the lack of services to 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#prevent">prevent</a> disease. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A group called <a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#oral">Oral</a> Health America in Chicago, Illinois, 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#release">released</a> the 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#findings">findings</a>. It used information from recent government studies to 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#prepare">prepare</a> the 
report. The group's leader says the report shows the nation needs to 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#be concerned about">be more 
concerned about</a> the oral health of its citizens. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One major problem is <a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#tooth decay">tooth decay</a>. 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#bacteria">Bacteria</a> in the mouth act on sugars that 
remain on the teeth after eating. This 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#action">action</a> creates acid that damages the 
tooth. The damage appears as a hole in the tooth called a 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#cavity">cavity</a>. The part of 
the tooth that has been destroyed by the acid is called tooth decay. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There are many reasons for diseases of the teeth and gums. The report says 
many areas in the United States fail to add enough 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#fluoride">fluoride</a> to public drinking 
water. It notes that ten states failed to provide fluoridated water for at least 
fifty percent of their population. Fluoride is an element found in rocks and 
minerals. Drinking <a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#fluoridated water">fluoridated water</a> is one of the best ways to prevent tooth 
decay. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The report shows that many Americans do not have their teeth examined by a 
dentist or trained expert. In most states, 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#one-third">one-third</a> or more of the citizens 
failed to visit a dentist at least once last year. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In addition, a person's <a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#earnings">earnings</a> seemed to 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#have an effect on">have a major effect on</a> the 
services received. Poor people are less likely to visit a dentist. More than 
one-hundred-million American adults and children do not have insurance to help 
pay for <a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#treatment">treatment</a> by a dentist.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One area of progress is increased public understanding of 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#oral health issues">oral health issues</a>. 
The report notes that several states now 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#employ">employ</a> dental health directors. Oral 
Health America says the increased understanding is partly a result of American 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#surgeon">Surgeon</a> General David Satcher. Two years ago, he released a report on the 
importance of oral health. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">His report noted that more than thirty-thousand Americans 
<a target="bottom" href="0005-4.htm#develop">develop</a> cancers in 
the mouth or throat every year. It also found that tooth decay is the most 
common disease among American children. Fifty percent of all six-year-old 
children already have tooth decay. </font> </p>
