<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Earlier this week, the United States 
<a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#Federal Reserve Board">Federal Reserve Board</a> announced another cut in the amount banks pay to borrow 
money for a short term. The Federal Reserve Board is a part of America's 
<a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#central bank">central 
bank</a>. </font></p>


<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The United States Congress established 
the <a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve System</a> in Nineteen-Thirteen when it approved the Federal 
Reserve Act. The <a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#legislation">legislation</a> created Federal Reserve banks in twelve areas of 
the country. They are supervised by the 
<a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#board">Board</a> of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System. All national banks must be members of the system. State banks 
can be members if they meet federal requirements. </font></p>


<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Seven people serve on 
<a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#Board of Governors">the Board of 
Governors</a>. The group is usually known as the Federal Reserve Board. Each member 
is appointed by the President of the United States to a fourteen year term. The 
Senate must approve the appointments of the board members.</font></p>


<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The President names one member to serve 
as chairman for four years. The current chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is 
Alan Greenspan. He took office for a fourth term as Federal Reserve Chairman on 
June twentieth of the year Two-Thousand. Mister Greenspan has been named 
chairman by presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton. </font></p>


<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The main responsibility of the Federal 
Reserve Board is to influence the economy of the United States to avoid 
<a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#inflation">inflation</a> and support continuing growth. It does this by controlling the 
nation's banking system and money supply. The Federal Reserve also sets 
important interest rates. Interest is the money people or businesses pay to 
banks for borrowing money.</font></p>


<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Federal Reserve establishes 
interest rates for loans that banks in the federal banking system make to each 
other. This is the <a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#federal funds">federal funds</a> rate. This rate influences interest rates for 
all other kinds of loans in the country. About two-thirds of the economic 
activity in the United States depends on personal spending. Lower interest rates 
set by the Federal Reserve Board 
<a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#are supposed to increase">are supposed to increase</a> personal spending by 
<a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#reduce">reducing</a> the cost of borrowing. </font></p>


<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Federal Reserve Board has been 
reducing the federal funds interest rate all year. It started with a half-point 
cut on the second business day in January. It continued to cut a half-point at 
each of the three Board meetings since then. The Board even cut another 
half-point between meetings on April eighteenth. This reduced the rate from six 
and one-half percent in January to four percent. Then on Wednesday, the Board 
cut the interest rate by one-quarter percent. So the federal funds rate is now 
three and three quarters percent. Experts say the series of interest rate cuts 
this year is the most <a target="bottom" href="0028-4.htm#aggressive">aggressive</a> action taken by the American central bank in 
nineteen years. </font></p>
