<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The declaration of a national Thanksgiving holiday 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#to result from...">resulted from</a> the efforts of 
one woman, <a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#Sarah Josepha Hale">Sarah Josepha Hale</a>. She began her 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#campaign">campaign</a> in the eighteen-twenties. 
Missus Hale was a writer. She wrote stories about a national day of Thanksgiving 
in a <a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#publication for women">publication for women</a>. She also wrote many letters to Presidents and other 
public officials. She urged them to support the idea. Support grew slowly. 
Finally, in eighteen-sixty-three, President Abraham Lincoln declared the fourth 
Thursday in November as a national holiday of Thanksgiving. <br>
<br>
At that time, the United States was fighting a civil war. President Lincoln 
liked the idea of a Thanksgiving holiday that would also celebrate 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#national unity">national 
unity</a>. Since then, the United States has always celebrated the Thanksgiving 
holiday. <br>
<br>
American writer <a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#Diana Karter Appelbaum">Diana Karter Appelbaum</a> wrote a book about Thanksgiving. She said 
Thanksgiving became important partly because the United States was a new nation. 
She said the United States needed traditions that would help 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#hold sth. together">hold the new nation 
together</a>. <br>
<br>
Over the years, some new traditions were added to America's Thanksgiving 
celebration. For example, <a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#a number of...">a number of</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#professional">professional</a> and university football games 
are played on Thanksgiving Day. Some of the games are broadcast on national 
television.<br>
<br>
Several Thanksgiving Day <a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#parade">parades</a> are broadcast on television, too. These parades 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#organize">are organized by</a> big stores in several American cities. The parade organized by 
the Macy's store in New York is the biggest.<br>
<br>
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#giant">Giant</a> balloons twenty meters high 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#float">float</a> above the street. The balloons are in 
the shape of creatures from popular cartoons and 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#television program">television programs</a>. People on 
the ground hold heavy ropes so the balloons do not fly away.<br>
<br>
Thanksgiving also is a time when Americans 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#share sth. with sb.">share what they have with those</a> who 
do not have much. Churches and other groups 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#provide sth. for sb.">provide free Thanksgiving meals for 
old people</a>, the homeless, and the poor. Many Americans give turkeys or other 
food to these groups. Some spend part of the day helping to 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#prepare meals">prepare</a> and 
<a target="bottom" href="0036-4.htm#serve">serve 
the meals</a>. <br>
<br>
Religious ceremonies are an important part of Thanksgiving Day for many 
Americans. People join in prayers and songs of Thanksgiving. One of the most 
famous songs is called &quot;Prayer of Thanksgiving.&quot; <br>
<br>
The words and music tell of the traditional meaning of Thanksgiving. We gather 
with our family. We share what we have, and we give thanks for the good things 
of the past year. Here is the Boston Pops Orchestra and Chorus singing &quot;Prayer 
of Thanksgiving.&quot; <br>
<br>
This program was written by Carolyn Weaver. It was produced by Caty Weaver. Our 
engineer was Holly Capehart. I'm Sarah Long, and I'm Shirley Griffith. Join us 
again next week for another report about life in the United States on the VOA 
Special English program, This Is America.<br>
