American scientists say the first plants may have appeared on Earth hundreds of 
millions of years earlier than fossil records suggest. They say this could have 
had a major effect on the climate and development of life on Earth. <br>
<br>
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University studied genetic evidence from the 
modern-day plants that developed from early plants. The evidence suggests that 
organisms called fungi first appeared on land more than one-thousand-million 
years ago. It shows that plants first appeared on land about 
seven-hundred-million years ago. Land plants and fungi are believed to have 
developed from sea plants called algae. <br>
<br>
Until now, scientists had believed plants and fungi first appeared on land about 
five-hundred-million years ago. That estimate was based on the oldest-known 
fossils. <br>
<br>
The new theory has led researchers to believe that the presence of plants may 
have led to the early development of animal life. They say plants may have 
changed the Earth's climate and caused a cooling period when the Earth was 
covered with ice. That was followed by the appearance of animal life about 
five-hundred-million years ago. This event is called the Cambrian Explosion. <br>
<br>
Plants produce oxygen, which animals need to survive. They also lower the levels 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide traps heat from the sun in 
the atmosphere and causes the Earth to warm. <br>
<br>
Researchers say plants could have increased oxygen and lowered carbon dioxide 
enough for animals to grow larger and develop into different species. <br>
<br>
Some scientists have believed that plants and fungi could have appeared much 
earlier than first thought. But they had no record of this because fossils of 
early plants have not been discovered. Scientists believe that plant tissues 
were too soft to be protected as fossils in rock. <br>
<br>
Researchers made the new finding by studying the genes of living kinds of fungi, 
plants and animals. They studied the rate of change in the genes of species 
during the passage of time. Genes change at a similar rate when a new species 
develops. The scientists matched this &quot;genetic clock&quot; with evolutionary events 
whose dates have been proven in the fossil record. This helped them estimate how 
long ago a species developed. <br>
