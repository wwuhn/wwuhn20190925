<br>
American scientists say the first plants may have ！______ on Earth hundreds of 
millions of years earlier than fossil records ______. They say this could have 
had a major ______ on the climate and development of life on Earth. <br>
<br>
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University studied ______ evidence from the 
modern-day plants that ______ from early plants. The evidence suggests that 
organisms ______ fungi first appeared on land more than one-thousand-million 
______ ago. It shows that plants first appeared on ______ about 
seven-hundred-million years ago. Land plants and fungi are ______ to have 
developed from sea plants called algae. <br>
<br>
Until now, ______ had believed plants and fungi first appeared on land ______ 
five-hundred-million years ago. That estimate was ______ on the oldest-known 
fossils. <br>
<br>
The new ______ has led researchers to believe that the ______ of plants may have 
led to the ______ development of animal life. They say ______ may have changed 
the Earth's climate and ______ a cooling period when the Earth was ______ with 
ice. That was followed by the appearance of ______ life about 
five-hundred-million years ago. This ______ is called the Cambrian Explosion. <br>
<br>
Plants ______ oxygen, which animals need to survive. They also ______ the levels 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide ______ heat from the sun in 
the atmosphere and ______ the Earth to warm. <br>
<br>
Researchers say plants could have ______ oxygen and lowered carbon dioxide 
______ for animals to grow larger and develop into ______ species. <br>
<br>
Some scientists have believed that ______ and fungi could have appeared much 
______ than first thought. But they had no record of this ______ fossils of 
early plants have not been ______ . Scientists believe that plant tissues were 
too soft to be ______ as fossils in rock. <br>
<br>
Researchers made the new ______ by studying the genes of living ______ of fungi, 
plants and animals. They studied the ______ of change in the genes of species 
during the ______ of time. Genes change at a similar rate when a new ______ 
develops. The scientists matched this &quot;genetic clock&quot; with ______ events whose 
dates have been ______ in the fossil record. This helped them ______ how long 
ago a species developed. <br>
