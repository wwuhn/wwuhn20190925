<P align="center" ><STRONG>Three passions<BR>
  by Bertrand Russell</STRONG> </P>
<P >&nbsp;&nbsp; Three passions, 
  simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my 
  life:the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and 
  unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, 
  like great winds,have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward 
  course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge 
  of despair.</P>
<P >I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy 
  Cecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the 
  rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, 
  next, because it relieves loneliness--that terrible loneliness 
  in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the 
  world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought 
  it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a 
  mystic miniature,the prefiguring vision of the heaven that 
  saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and 
  though it might seem too good for human life, this is what- at 
  last- I have found.</P>
<P >With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have 
  wished to understand the hearts of men. I have tried to 
  apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above 
  the flu.A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.</P>
<P >Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, 
  led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back 
  to earth.Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. 
  Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old 
  people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of 
  loneliness,poverty,and pain make a mockery of what human life 
  should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too 
  suffer.</P>
<P >This has been my life. I have found it worth living, 
  and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered 
  me.</P>
