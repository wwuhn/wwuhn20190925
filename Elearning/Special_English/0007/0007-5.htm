<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is Bill White with the VOA Special English Agriculture Report.
</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Scientists have produced the first tomato that ______ grow in salty water. Salty 
water is ______ harmful to plants. Plant expert Eduardo Blumwald ______ his team 
found a way to direct ______ away from the fruit of tomato plants. ______ Blumwald 
works at the University of California ______ Davis. The tomatoes were grown at the 
______ of Toronto in Ontario, Canada. The ______ Nature Biotechnology 
reported the findings. Mister Blumwald ______ the discovery will be important for 
agriculture ______ the world. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Farmers use irrigation to water ______ by other than natural methods. It helps 
______ in areas that have long periods of ______ or no rainfall. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Crop irrigation also increases ______ salt levels of soils and water. It 
______ sodium, calcium, magnesium and other chemicals in ______ farm land. The chemicals 
come from the______ soils and rock that the water passes ______. With time, they 
decrease the productivity of ______ land. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Experts at the University of California ______ that high levels of salt from 
irrigation ______ damaged about forty percent of the world's ______. American 
officials estimate that irrigation-produced salt is ______ for the loss of 
ten-million hectares of farmland ______ each year. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Many areas treated with irrigated ______ are so salty that some crops can no 
______ grow. Salty water harms the ability of ______ plants to take in water 
through their ______ cells. The flow of water into the ______ may stop if salt 
levels in the soil ______ very high. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mister Blumwald's team used genetic ______ to stop this effect. The 
scientists gave ______ tomato plants a gene from the Arabidopsis ______. The gene 
controls the production of a ______ protein. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The transport protein uses energy in cells to ______ salt into areas within 
cells called vacuoles. ______ the salt is inside vacuoles it cannot ______ with 
the plant's normal biochemical activity. The salt-storing ______ takes place 
only in the leaves of the ______ plants. So the tomato fruit is not ______.
</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The researchers say these tomato plants also ______ salt from the soil. The 
scientists ______ the plants grew and produced fruit in ______ fifty times saltier 
than normal. Experts say ______ tomatoes offer hope that other crops can be 
______ engineered to grow in areas of the world ______ have salty irrigation 
water and salt-damaged soil. </font></b> </p>
