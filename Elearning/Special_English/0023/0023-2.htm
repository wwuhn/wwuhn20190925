<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Increasing numbers of farmers are growing genetically engineered crops.
A new report also says that the total land area where such crops are grown is increasing.
The

<a target="bottom" href="0023-4.htm#genetic engineering"><font size="4">Genetic engineering</font></a><font size="4"> is the technology of changing the genes of living things.
Genes are parts of cells that control growth and development.
A changed gene directs a plant or other organism to do things it normally does not do.
For example, a plant may be

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">There is <a target="bottom" href="0023-4.htm#plenty of">plenty of</a> conflicting information about genetically engineered crops.
The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications supports growing such crops in developing countries.
So do the United Nations Development Program and other groups. </font>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">However, critics of genetic engineering say the technology is a threat to human health and the environment.

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The new report estimates that farmers grew genetically engineered crops on more than fifty-two-million hectares of farmland last year.
That represents an increase in land area of nineteen percent
<a target="bottom" href="0023-4.htm#compared to...">compared to</a> the year before.

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The report estimates that more than five-million farmers grew genetically engineered crops in thirteen countries last year.
Four countries grew ninety-nine percent of all genetically engineered crops last year.
The United States grew sixty-eight percent of the world total.
Argentina grew twenty-two percent.
Canada was next with six percent.
China had three percent. </font>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The report says soybeans were the most common genetically engineered crop.
They were grown on thirty-three-million hectares of farmland.
Other common genetically engineered crops were corn, cotton and

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In a separate development, scientists report that genetic material from genetically engineered plants can
<a target="bottom" href="0023-4.htm#spread to" style="text-decoration: none"><i>
<b>spread</b></i> </a>across great distances <i><b>to</b></i> native plants.
The scientists say the genes were found in wild corn growing in the mountains of southern Mexico.
The finding is most unusual because the Mexican government has
<a target="bottom" href="0023-4.htm#ban">banned</a> the planting of genetically engineered corn since Nineteen-Ninety-Eight.
