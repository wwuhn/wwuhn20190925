<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It is one of America's most popular holidays. It is a day for expressing thanks 
for the good things in life, especially family and friends. I'm Shirley 
Griffith. and I'm Sarah Long. The story of Thanksgiving is our report today on 
the VOA special English program, This is America. <br>
<br>
This Thursday is Thanksgiving day. The writer O. Henry called it the one day 
that is purely American. Thanksgiving is not a 
<a target="bottom" href="0034-4.htm#religious">religious</a> holiday. But it has 
<a target="bottom" href="0034-4.htm#spiritual">spiritual</a> meaning. Some Americans

morning. Others travel long distances to be with their families. They have a 
large dinner, which is the main part of the celebration. <br>
<br>
For many Americans, Thanksgiving is the only time of year when all members of a 
family gather together. So, the holiday is considered a time of family

About thirty-million Americans are expected to travel this week to be with their 
families. It is the busiest travel time of the year in the United States. <br>

More than any other holiday, Thanksgiving is a celebration of family and home. 
Here is part of a <a target="bottom" href="0034-4.htm#traditional">traditional</a> Thanksgiving song. It is called &quot;<a target="bottom" href="0034-4.htm#bless">Bless</a> This 
House.&quot; It is sung by the Mormon Tabernacle

<br>
On Thanksgiving, family and friends enjoy a long day of cooking, eating, and 
talking. The Thanksgiving meal almost always includes turkey meat with a bread

the year. And many people eat more food on Thanksgiving than at any other time 
of the year. <br>
