</font> </p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is Bill White with the VOA Special English Environment Report.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">We usually think of <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#pollution">pollution</a> as a harmful waste substance that threatens the 
air and water. But some people have <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#concern">become concerned about</a> another kind of 
pollution. It can be everywhere, 
<a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#depending on...">depending on</a> the time of day. And it is not 
thought of as a substance. It is light. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The idea of light pollution has developed with the increase of lights in 
cities. In many areas, this light makes it difficult or impossible to observe 
stars and <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#planet">planets</a> in the night sky. In Nineteen-Eighty-Eight, 
<a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#International Dark-Sky Association">the International 
Dark-Sky Association</a> formed. This organization wants to reduce light pollution 
in the night sky. It also <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#urge">urges</a> the effective use of electric lighting.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There are a number of reasons why light pollution is important. One has 
become clear at the Mount Wilson 
<a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#observatory">Observatory</a> near 
<a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California. Mount 
Wilson Observatory was home to the largest 
<a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#telescope">telescopes</a> in the world during the 
first half of the Nineteen-Hundreds. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">During that period, Los Angeles grew to become one of America's biggest 
cities. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Today, light from Los Angeles makes the night sky above Mount Wilson very 
bright. It is no longer an important research center because of light pollution.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Light pollution threatens to reduce the scientific value of research 
telescopes in other important observatories. They include Lick Observatory near 
San Jose, California and Yerkes Observatory near Chicago, Illinois. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Light pollution is the result of wasted energy. Bright light that 
<a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#shine">shines</a> into 
the sky is not being used to provide light where it is needed on Earth. Poorly 
designed lighting causes a great deal of light pollution. Lights that are 
brighter than necessary also cause light pollution. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Recently, two Italian <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#astronomer">astronomers</a> and an American environmental scientist 
created a world map of the night sky. The map shows that North America, Western 
Europe and Japan have the greatest <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#amount">amount</a> of light pollution.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Most people in America are surprised to find out that they are able to see 
our own <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#galaxy">galaxy</a>, The Milky Way, with their own eyes. But about three-fourths of 
Americans cannot see <a target="bottom" href="0016-4.htm#the Milky Way">the Milky Way</a> because of man-made light.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Objects in the night sky are resources that provide everyone with wonder. But 
light pollution threatens to prevent those wonderful sights from being seen.
