<P>The most effective way to find a job is through networking. Family, friends, neighbors, people you worked with in your last job, classmates, and other people you know can help you find a job. Ask them to help you. This is called networking. You can begin networking with anyone who knows people and is willing to talk to you. The people you are then referred to are likely to know even more about the job you want. Each referral will try to be helpful and refer you to someone who knows even more than they do.
<P>You need to convince the people you see that you have the skills to do a good job. They must like you, or it will be difficult to get them to help you. Tell them what kind of job you are looking for and what skills, experience, and other credentials you have for that job. <HR>
