<P>A completed job application provides the employer with two kinds of information about you. First, it provides answers to questions about your education and work experience. Second, it provides information about your ability to follow directions, work neatly, spell correctly, and provide accurate and complete data. This information is provided by "how" you fill out the application form.
<P>A completed job application is a statement about your personal, educational, and work experience. It is also a statement about some of your other very important characteristics as a person and as a prospective employee. It is very important that you take the time to make every job application that you fill out a very positive statement about you as a person and as a future employee. You need to be thorough in your preparation and then careful while you are filling the application out.
<P>When you fill out the form, be sure to follow directions. Be neat. Provide only positive information. For example, list any unpaid volunteer experience in the work experience section. The job application represents who you are. <HR>
