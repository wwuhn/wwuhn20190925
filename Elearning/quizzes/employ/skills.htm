<P>Skills are the activities that a person does well. What things are you good at doing? Everyone has many skills. Sometimes it is difficult to recognize the skills that you have.
<P>Job skills are abilities you need for a specific job. For example, a chef needs to know how to cook and bake. A taxi driver needs to know how to drive a car and read signs. A secretary needs to know how to type and take messages.
<P>Transferable skills are skills you can use in many different jobs. You can take skills from one job and use them in a very different job. Speaking English well, for instance, is a skill you can use in almost any job. Some examples of transferable skills are teaching other people, solving problems, accepting responsibility, organizing projects, making decisions, and creating new ideas. Employers want to select employees who have or who can learn the skills necessary to do the job.<BR></BODY></html> <GDRTVU Dept of FL, 2003-07, ZJW>
