<P>Job duties are tasks you must do on a job. They are the responsibilities you have for a particular job. A job description lists the duties you will do for your job. For example, an auto mechanic would repair and paint cars. A file clerk would file forms, answer the telephones, and sort mail. A bookkeeper would prepare bills, keep books, and type bills. The list of activities you are required to perform for any occupation are the job duties. <HR>
