<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The World Health Organization has
<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#call for">called for</a> immediate action to stop the 
growing threat of drug resistance around the world. Gro Harlem Brundtland is the 
Director-General of the W-H-O. She says that a growing number of important drugs 
are becoming <a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#ineffective">ineffective</a>.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the past five years, drug companies have spent more than 
seventeen-thousand-million dollars researching and developing medicines used to

<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#infectious">infectious diseases</a>. However, the W-H-O says much of that investment could 
be lost if the problem of drug resistance is not solved quickly. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The organization says the problem is affecting many
<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#deadly disease">deadly diseases</a>. They 
include <a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>,

have even become <a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#resistant to.">resistant to</a> infections spread through sex.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Rosamund Williams is head of the W-H-O's Anti-Microbial Resistance Program. 
She says the problem of drug resistance exists in both rich and poor countries. 
Doctor Williams says the spread of infections is a serious problem because 
people can now travel anywhere in the world in less than twenty-four hours.
<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#in addition">In 
addition</a>, she says the problem of infections is increasing among poor people 
living in <a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#over-crowded">over-crowded</a> or unclean areas.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The W-H-O says using too many
<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#antibiotics">antibiotics</a> in industrial countries and not 
enough of the drugs in poor countries can lead to drug resistance. The use of 
antibiotics in food production also adds to increased drug resistance. 
Currently, about fifty percent of all antibiotic production is used in 
agriculture to treat sick animals and to increase the size of farm animals. The 
World Health Organization warns that drug-resistant organisms in animals can be
<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#pass on">passed on to</a> humans.
<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#as a result">As a result</a>, the W-H-O says the use of antibiotics to 
improve growth in animals should be halted. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The World Health Organization has launched a new plan to halt the spread of 
drug resistance. It is designed for patients, doctors, hospital officials and 
health ministers. Its goal is for all of them to support the best use of drugs
<a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#so that">so that</a> treatments continue to be effective for all patients. For example, 
patients should not <a target="bottom" href="0027-4.htm#put pressure on">put pressure on</a> doctors to give them antibiotics. And 
doctors should use only the drugs that are required to treat a patient. </font> </p>
