<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is Bill White with the VOA Special English Science Report.

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">French doctors and American scientists have reported 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#perform">performing</a> a complete 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#operation">operation</a> in which the doctor was outside the 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#operating room">operating room</a>. This kind of 
operation <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#be known as">is known as</a> robotic surgery.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#Jacques Marescaux">Jacques Marescaux</a> performed the operation last month. He 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#remove">removed</a> the 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#gallbladder">gallbladder</a> of a sixty-eight-year-old woman. Doctor Marescaux was in an office 
in New York City. The patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France. The 
operation <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#be described">was described</a> in the 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#publication">publication</a> <i>Nature</i>.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A doctor in the operating room in Strasbourg prepared the patient. The doctor 
placed medical <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#instrument">instruments</a> and a small 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#video camera">video camera</a> in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he moved 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#control">controls</a> that sent messages to the robot machine in the operating room. The 
robot moved the instruments that <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#remove">removed</a> the woman's gallbladder. The woman 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#fully recover">fully recovered</a> and left the hospital two days later.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Doctors have used similar robots in other operations. But the doctor has 
never been so far away from the patient. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Experts say the main problem with such robotic surgery 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#guarantee">is guaranteeing</a> 
high-speed <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#telecommunication">telecommunications</a> between the doctor and the robot. Technology must 
be able to reduce the <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#time delay">time delay</a> between a doctor's order to a robot to move the 
instruments and the robot's actions. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Experts say successful robotic surgery will improve operations. For example, 
the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. The robot movement 
is <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#steady">steady</a> and will never shake. A robot machine can turn instruments in ways 
that a doctor's hands cannot. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Doctors say such robotic surgery will make possible safer and better 
operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It also will 
mean that doctors could <a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#operate on...">operate on</a> people in dangerous places far away. These 
might include soldiers in battle areas or astronauts in space. And it could mean 
that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel 
to the city where the doctor works. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The use of robotic surgery is now being tested in the United States. About 
one-hundred people have had operations using the new technology. They have had 
stomach and gallbladder operations. Doctors also are using the new technology to 
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#sew">sew</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0011-4.htm#blood vessels">blood vessels</a> together during heart operations.
