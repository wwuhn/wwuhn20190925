<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Street food is food that is <a href="0003-4.htm#prepare">prepared</a>, sold and eaten on city streets. Street 
food is an important part of the <a href="0003-4.htm#diet">diets</a> of people in developing countries. An 
<a href="0003-4.htm#estimate">estimated</a> two-thousand-five-hundred-million people 
<a href="0003-4.htm#worldwide">worldwide</a> eat street food. 
This kind of food is low in cost, <a href="0003-4.htm#tasty">tasty</a>, 
<a href="0003-4.htm#nutritious">nutritious</a> and easy to 
<a href="0003-4.htm#serve">serve</a>. It <a href="0003-4.htm#designed for">is 
designed for</a> the lives of busy people in large cities. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">But buyers must <b>be careful about</b> health risks. Studies have 
<a href="0003-4.htm#repeatedly">repeatedly</a> found 
<a href="0003-4.htm#unacceptably">unacceptably</a> high levels of harmful 
<a href="0003-4.htm#bacteria">bacteria</a> in street food products. Recently, 
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported on the problem.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Street food sellers in developing countries often <a href="0003-4.htm#lack">lack</a> the 
<a href="0003-4.htm#storage">storage</a>, cooking 
and cooling equipment necessary to prevent the <a href="0003-4.htm#formation">formation</a> of dangerous bacteria. 
Under some conditions, a single bacterium can <a href="0003-4.htm#grow">grow into</a> seventeen-million 
<a href="0003-4.htm#disease-carrying">disease-carrying</a>
<a href="0003-4.htm#organism">organisms</a> in just eight hours. The lack of clean running water 
and waste removal systems also increases the risk of infection. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Food and Agriculture Organization <a href="0003-4.htm#to lead an effort">is leading an effort</a> to make street 
food safer. Over the past fifteen years, it has helped officials improve street 
food in more than twenty cities worldwide. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For example, F-A-O officials have been working with the South African 
government on such a project. The U-N agency <a href="0003-4.htm#to produce">produced</a> a food safety 
<a href="0003-4.htm#teaching guide">teaching 
guide</a> for public health officials. The guide offers suggestions on how to 
<a href="0003-4.htm#prepare">prepare food</a> safely. A videotape shows how 
<a href="0003-4.htm#to produce">producing safe food results</a> in 
increased business. The F-A-O also helped publish books that food inspectors 
will use to educate people who sell street food. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One F-A-O official says the project in South Africa has been 
<a href="0003-4.htm#so...that">so successful 
that</a> officials in other African countries would like to copy it. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">F-A-O officials and officials in Senegal have begun to 
<a href="0003-4.htm#improve">improve</a> the safety of 
street food businesses in Dakar. A new market area is being built for the city. 
Businesses in the area will have waste removal services and fresh water. Food 
sellers are being taught to keep cooked food away from uncooked food. The 
sellers also have been <a href="0003-4.htm#urge">urged</a> not to 
<a href="0003-4.htm#prepare">prepare</a> and sell food when they are sick.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One F-A-O official <a href="0003-4.htm#note">notes</a> that sellers of street food products welcome the 
advice. She says they recognize that buyers will come back if they believe in 
the safety of the products. </font> </p>
