<p>　<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Thanksgiving is celebrated every year on the fourth Thursday of November. The 
month of November is autumn in the United States. Autumn is the season when 
crops are gathered. When the first European settlers in America gathered their 
crops, they celebrated. They thanked their God for the success of the harvest.

<a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#held earlier Thanksgiving celebrations">held earlier Thanksgiving celebrations</a>. But the Pilgrims' Thanksgiving 
story is the most popular.<br>
<br>
The <a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#Pilgrim settler">Pilgrims</a> were 
<a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#religious dissident">religious dissidents</a> who fled oppression in England. They went 
first to the Netherlands. Then they left that country to 
<a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#establish">establish</a> a colony in 
north America. The Pilgrims landed in sixteen-twenty in what later became known 
as Plymouth, Massachusetts.<br>
<br>
Their voyage across the Atlantic Ocean was difficult. Their first months in 
America were difficult, too. About one-hundred Pilgrims landed just as autumn 
was turning to winter. During the cold months that followed, about half of them 
died.<br>
<br>
When spring came, the Pilgrims began planting crops. A native American Indian 
named Squanto helped them. When summer ended, the Pilgrims had a good harvest of 
corn and barley. Some vegetables had grown poorly. yet there was enough food to 
last through the winter. <br>
<br>
The Pilgrims decided to 
<a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#held earlier Thanksgiving celebrations">hold a celebration</a> to give thanks for their harvest. 
Writings from that time say that Pilgrim leader William Bradford set a date late 
in the year. He invited members of a nearby Indian tribe to 
<a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#take part">take part</a>. <br>
<br>
That Thanksgiving celebration lasted three days. There were many kinds of foods 
to eat. The meal included <a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#bird">wild birds</a> such as ducks, geese, and -- possibly -- 
turkeys. <br>
<br>
The Pilgrims did not 
<a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#held earlier Thanksgiving celebrations">hold another Thanksgiving celebration</a> until two years 
later. The celebration marked the end of a period of dry weather that had almost 
destroyed their crops. Historians believe that the Pilgrims's second 
Thanksgiving was held in July.<br>
<br>
The Pilgrims did not plan to establish a yearly Thanksgiving holiday. but as the 
American colonies grew, Thanksgiving -- or harvest -- celebrations were held in 
many towns and <a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#settlement">settlements</a>. They were held on many different days. It was not 
until about two-hundred-fifty years later that a national day for Thanksgiving 
was <a target="bottom" href="0035-4.htm#declare">declared</a>. <br>
