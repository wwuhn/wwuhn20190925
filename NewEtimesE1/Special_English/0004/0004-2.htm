<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is Bill White with the VOA Special English SCIENCE REPORT.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The World Health Organization estimates that more than four-million people 
die each year from the <a href="0004-4.htm#effect">effects</a> of smoking 
<a href="0004-4.htm#tobacco">tobacco</a>. That number is 
<a href="0004-4.htm#increasing">increasing</a>. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">W-H-O officials expect one-hundred-fifty- million people to die from tobacco 
use in the next twenty years. Seven in ten of those deaths will be in developing 
countries. These numbers are <a href="0004-4.htm#frightening">frightening</a>.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Yet people around the world continue to smoke.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the United States, about forty-seven-million adults 
<a href="0004-4.htm#currently">currently</a> smoke. 
American health experts say tobacco use is the <a href="0004-4.htm#leading">leading</a>
<a href="0004-4.htm#preventable">preventable</a> cause of 
death <a href="0004-4.htm#nationwide">nationwide</a>. This year, more than four-hundred-thirty-thousand Americans 
will die of diseases <a href="0004-4.htm#link">linked to</a> smoking. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">One day last month, thousands of Americans attempted to stop smoking. They 
were taking part in the Great American Smokeout. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The American Cancer Society has organized the Great American Smokeout every 
year for twenty-five years. The goal is to show the dangers of smoking and 
provide support for people who decide to stop smoking. The American Cancer 
Society says all cigarettes damage the body. It warns that smoking even a small 
number of cigarettes is dangerous. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is not easy to stop smoking permanently. However, doctors say you probably 
will live longer if you do stop smoking. You will feel better and look better. 
You also will protect the health of family members who breathe your smoke.
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The American Cancer Society says there is not just one right way to stop 
smoking. It says one method or a combination of methods may be successful. They 
include attending self-help programs or following directions in a book. The 
group says any way to stop smoking that is legal, moral and effective is worth 
trying. This could include taking long walks or spending time in areas where 
smoking is banned. Also, you could eat a small piece of fruit or vegetable 
instead of having a cigarette. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The American Cancer Society says the sooner smokers stop smoking, the more 
they can reduce their chances of getting cancer and other diseases. It says 
blood pressure returns to normal twenty minutes after smoking the last 
cigarette. Carbon monoxide gas levels in the blood return to normal after eight 
hours. After one day, the chance of heart attack decreases. After one year, the 
risk of heart disease for a non-smoker is half that of a smoker. </font> </p>
