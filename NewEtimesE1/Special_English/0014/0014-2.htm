<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The United States Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, has 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#announce">announced</a> a 
program to develop a new kind of <a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#engine">engine</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#to power cars">to power cars</a> in the future. Mister 
Abraham calls the new program the &quot;Freedom Car.&quot; The cars will use 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#energy">energy</a> from 
chemical fuel cells. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Fuel cell technology uses <a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#hydrogen">hydrogen</a> to create electricity. Hydrogen gas is 
passed over a metal like <a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#platinum">platinum</a>. The 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#electron">electrons</a> from the hydrogen separate to 
form <a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#electricity">electricity</a>. The 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#remaining">remaining</a> part of the
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#atom">atom</a>, the 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#proton">proton</a>, 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#combine">combines with</a> 
oxygen to form water. Fuel cells create very clean energy with no pollution.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However, they need to be very large to create enough electricity to power a 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#vehicle">vehicle</a>. A company called Fuel Cell Energy has proposed a fuel cell that also 
uses a <a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#coal-powered">coal-powered</a> device to create power. But this device is very large and 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#costly">costly</a>. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Experts believe that fuel cell energy will 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#some day">some day</a> provide power for small 
devices like <a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#cellular telephone">cellular telephones</a> and computers. Peter Hoffman is editor and 
publisher of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Letter. He supports developing fuel cell 
energy technology. However, he estimates that a fuel cell car could cost between 
seventy-five-thousand and one-hundred-fifty-thousand dollars. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In Nineteen-Ninety-Three, the Clinton 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#administration">administration</a> began a program to 
develop cars that use about three times less fuel than current cars. The 
government was to spend one-thousand-five-hundred-million dollars on research. 
However, the Bush administration has decided not to continue that effort. 
Instead, it will support the program to develop cars that are powered by fuel 
cells. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Other kinds of cars that use less fuel are 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#currently">currently</a> being sold in the United 
States. The Japanese car company Toyota makes the Prius. The Prius is called 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#a hybrid car">a 
hybrid car</a> because it uses both electricity and gas to run its engine. It uses 
less gas and produces less pollution than normal cars. 
<a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#Toyota">Toyota</a> has sold 
twenty-thousand of these cars in the United States. This new hybrid car has 
become very <a target="bottom" href="0014-4.htm#popular">popular</a>. Every Prius made has been sold. In fact, there are not 
enough of these cars being made for all the people who want them. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cars with fuel cells would create even less pollution than hybrid cars like 
the Toyota Prius. However, experts say cell cars will not be ready to be sold 
for ten to twenty years. </font> </p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">[Editor's note: Hydrogen fuel cells may hurt ozone layer<br>
In an article in this week's edition of Science magazine, researchers at the 
California Institute of Technology raised the possibility that if hydrogen fuel 
replaced fossil fuels entirely, it could be expected that 10 per cent to 20 per 
cent of the hydrogen would leak from pipelines, storage facilities, processing 
plants and fuel cells in cars and at power plants. </font> </p>
