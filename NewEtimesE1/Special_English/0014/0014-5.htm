</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, has ______ a 
program to develop a new kind of ______ to power cars in the future. Mister 
Abraham ______ the new program the &quot;Freedom Car.&quot; The cars ______ use energy from 
chemical fuel cells. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Fuel cell ______ uses hydrogen to create electricity. Hydrogen gas is 
______ over a metal like platinum. The electrons from ______ hydrogen separate to 
form electricity. The remaining part ______ the atom, the proton, combines with 
oxygen to ______ water. Fuel cells create very clean energy with ______ pollution.
</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">However, they need to be very ______ to create enough electricity to power a 
______. A company called Fuel Cell Energy has ______ a fuel cell that also 
uses a coal-powered ______ to create power. But this device is ______ large and 
costly. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Experts believe that fuel ______ energy will some day provide power for 
______ devices like cellular telephones and computers. Peter Hoffman is ______ and 
publisher of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell ______. He supports developing fuel cell 
energy technology. ______, he estimates that a fuel cell car could ______ between 
seventy-five-thousand and one-hundred-fifty-thousand ______. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Ninety-Three, the Clinton administration ______ a program to 
develop cars that use about ______ times less fuel than current cars. The 
government ______ to spend one-thousand-five-hundred-million dollars on ______. 
However, the Bush administration has decided not to ______ that effort. 
Instead, it will support the program to ______ cars that are powered by fuel 
cells. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">______ kinds of cars that use less fuel are ______ being sold in the United

hybrid car because it uses both electricity ______ gas to run its engine. It uses 
less ______ and produces less pollution than normal cars. Toyota ______ sold 
twenty-thousand of these cars in the United States. This ______ hybrid car has 
become very popular. Every Prius ______ has been sold. In fact, there are not 
______ of these cars being made for all the people ______ want them. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Cars with fuel cells would ______ even less pollution than hybrid cars like 
______ Toyota Prius. However, experts say cell cars will ______ be ready to be sold 
for ten to ______ years. </font></b> </p>
