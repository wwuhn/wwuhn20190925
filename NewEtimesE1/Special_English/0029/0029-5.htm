_______ on some important trade&nbsp; issues. China reached a ________ agreement with the United States last week. 
These ________&nbsp; have cleared the way for China to ________&nbsp; the World Trade 
Organization. The
process of admitting China is ________&nbsp; to begin at a W-T-O meeting Thursday 
________&nbsp; 
Geneva. </font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One-hundred-forty-one nations are W-T-O members now. 
These ________&nbsp; are
responsible for more than ninety percent of the world's ________ . The main goal of 
the W-T-O is to ________&nbsp; world trade flowing as smoothly and freely 
________&nbsp; possible. </font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The World Trade Organization was 
established in Nineteen-Ninety-Five. It ________&nbsp; out of the&nbsp; General 
Agreement on Tariffs and ________&nbsp; or GATT. GATT was 
created in
Nineteen-Forty-Eight after the ________&nbsp; of World War Two. It led to&nbsp; a 
________&nbsp; 
of international
trade&nbsp; negotiations which established a world ________&nbsp; system. The W-T-O supervises and makes improvements to 
________&nbsp; system. </font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The W-T-O organizes trade negotiations and 
settles&nbsp; trade ________ . It supervises
trade agreements reached by member nations. It ________&nbsp; provides developing 
countries with
technical&nbsp;  assistance and training ________&nbsp; in trade issues. And, it 
cooperates with
other ________&nbsp; organizations.</font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The top decision-making group of the W-T-O is the 
Ministerial Conference. It ________&nbsp; at
least once every two years in different ________&nbsp; around the world. W-T-O members 
reach agreements by&nbsp; ________&nbsp; and&nbsp; compromise. W-T-O agreements then go to 
the ________&nbsp; of each country for approval or rejection. </font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">At ________&nbsp; the trade agreements among the countries dealt 
mainly ________&nbsp; goods. GATT was
designed to lower import taxes and ________&nbsp; other barriers to trade in 
goods. However,
W-T-O ________&nbsp; later agreed on trade rules for the service ________ . This 
industry includes
banks, communications companies, hotels and ________&nbsp; businesses. </font>
</b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The W-T-O also supervises an agreement on 
________&nbsp; is 
called&nbsp; intellectual property.
That agreement provides ________&nbsp; to protect trade and investment in ideas 
and ________&nbsp;
activities. </font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The W-T-O says its agreements permit 
________&nbsp; and 
producers more choices in the materials and ________&nbsp; that they use. The 
organization also says&nbsp; ________&nbsp; can feel secure about the openness of foreign 
________ . The W-T-O says the result is 
a world ________&nbsp; that is stronger and more cooperative. </font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However, not everyone ________&nbsp; of the work of World 
Trade Organization. In ________&nbsp; last
few years, there have been major ________&nbsp; at meetings of the W-T-O, World 
Bank and ________&nbsp; similar organizations. Some of the protests have been&nbsp; 
________ .</font></b></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The protestors oppose opening world markets to 
________&nbsp; trade. They say the W-T-O
and its&nbsp;  allies are ________&nbsp; industrial nations rich by keeping 
developing nations poor. </font></b></p>
