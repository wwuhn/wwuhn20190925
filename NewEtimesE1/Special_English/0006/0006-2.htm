<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Experts say cars and crops <a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#compete for">are competing for</a> land in many parts of the world. 
They say this will <a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#increase">increase</a> in the future. Until now, most roads have been built 
over <a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#farmland">farmland</a> in 
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#industrial country">industrial countries</a>. However, the
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#Worldwatch Institute">Worldwatch Institute</a> says 
more and more farmland is now being lost in
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#developing country">developing countries</a>, where 
populations are often hungry. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#cropland">Croplands</a> are often covered with hard surface cement because flat, dry areas 
also <a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#make">make</a> good roads. However, once the cement has been 
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#pour">poured</a>, the land can not 
be easily <a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#redevelop">redeveloped</a> for crops. In the United States, more than six-million 
kilometers of land have been covered by roads. This is enough to 
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#circle">circle</a> the 
Earth at the equator one-hundred-fifty-seven times. The United States has more 
than two-hundred-million vehicles. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Worldwatch Institute says the increase in roads in developing countries 
is just starting to become an issue. It says more than eleven-million new cars 
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#be added to">are added to</a> the total number of vehicles around the world each year. Many of 
these new cars are in developing countries. This means the battle between crops 
and cars is starting to affect farming areas in countries where hunger is 
common. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Worldwatch Institute says there is not enough land in several developing 
countries to support transportation systems for cars and to feed the people. 
These countries include China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, 
Egypt and Mexico. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Worldwatch Institute says it is wrong for developing countries to 
financially support a car industry with money collected from 
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#taxpayer">taxpayers</a>. It says 
this takes money from poor people to support rich people. Instead, it says 
countries should build new transportation systems that help the whole 
population. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Experts say nearly three-thousand-million people 
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#be expected to">are expected to</a> be added to 
the world's population during the next fifty years. The Worldwatch Institute 
says most of these people will live in developing countries where there is not 
enough land to feed everyone and still have cars. It says food security in the 
future will <a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#depend on">depend on</a> governments 
<a target="bottom" href="0006-4.htm#invest on">investing more on</a> trains and bicycle systems 
and less on roads and car systems. </font> </p>
