<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Poe's best-known poem is the &quot;The Raven.&quot; Some people love it. They say it is 
like music. Others hate it. They say it sounds 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#forced">forced</a> and unnatural -- like bad 
music. &quot;The Raven&quot; is about a man whose great love, Lenore, has died. She 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#is gone forever">is 
gone forever</a>. But the man cannot accept that all happiness is gone. He sits 
alone among his books late at night. He hears a noise at the window. Here is the 
beginning of the poem: <br>
<br>
ANNOUNCER: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary Over 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#many a">many a</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#a quaint and curious volume of...">quaint and curious volume of</a> forgotten 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#lore">lore</a> -- While I nodded, nearly
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#nap">napping</a>, suddenly there came a 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#tapping">tapping</a>, 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#as of...">As of</a> someone gently rapping, rapping at 
my chamber door. &quot;Tis some visitor, I muttered, &quot;tapping at my chamber door -- 
Only this and nothing more.&quot; <br>
<br>
The man looks out the window and sees only blackness. <br>
<br>
ANNOUNCER: Deep <a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#peer into">into that darkness peering</a>, long I stood there wondering, 
fearing, Doubting, <a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#dream dreams">dreaming dreams</a> no mortal ever dared to dream before: But the 
silence was <a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#unbroken">unbroken</a>, and the stillness gave no
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#token">token</a>, And the only word there 
spoken was the whispered word, &quot;Lenore?&quot; This I 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#whisper">whispered</a>, and an echo
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#murmur">murmured</a> 
back the word, &quot;Lenore!&quot; Merely this and nothing more. <br>
<br>
But there is something at the window. It is a large black bird -- a raven. It 
comes into the room like the spirit of death and 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#hopelessness">hopelessness</a>. The raven can 
speak just one word: 'nevermore' -- meaning 'never again'. We know the raven 
will never leave the man's room. <br>
<br>
ANNOUNCER: But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one 
word, as if his soul in that one word he did 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#outpour">outpour</a>. Nothing farther than he
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#utter">uttered</a> -- not a feather then he 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#flutter">fluttered</a> -- Till I 
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#scarcely">scarcely</a> more than 
muttered, &quot;Other friends have flown before -- On the
<a target="bottom" href="0033-4.htm#morrow">morrow</a> he will leave me, as 
my Hopes have flown before.&quot; Then the bird said, &quot;Nevermore.&quot; <br>
