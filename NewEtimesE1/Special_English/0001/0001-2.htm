<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is the third time in five years that the bird flu virus has 
<a href="0001-4.htm#affect">affected</a> 
Hong Kong. Officials are now considering what additional

<a href="0001-4.htm#steps">take</a>. Some critics <a href="0001-4.htm#blame">blame</a> the problem on poor conditions at chicken farms. They

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Bird flu usually does not affect people. However, sometimes the flu virus 
changes. Five years ago, six people in Hong Kong died when they became infected 
with a flu virus <a href="0001-4.htm#found in">found in chickens</a>. Health officials then ordered the killing of 
all chickens, ducks and geese in Hong Kong. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Last May, a similar virus <a href="0001-4.htm#infect">infected</a> thousands of Hong Kong's chickens. 
Officials ordered the killing of more than one-million-three-hundred-thousand
