<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">One of the largest companies in the United States has failed.
The Enron Corporation has <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#ask sb. for sth.">asked a federal court for</a> protection because it can not pay the thousands of millions of dollars of money it
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#owe sb. money">owes</a>.
Enron is an energy trading company that buys and sells
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#electricity">electricity</a> and natural gas.
It also owns or controls several other companies that deal in several different products.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Enron <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#ask for...">asked for</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#bankruptcy">bankruptcy protection</a> for itself and fourteen of its companies.
Under the bankruptcy law, a business can continue to operate while it tries to negotiate new
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#credit">credit</a> with companies and banks to whom it owes money.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Enron began failing in October as some of its financial problems became known.
The value of its stock quickly fell.
The <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#stock">stock</a> closed Thursday at thirty-six cents a share.
Less than a year ago, each <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#share">share</a> of Enron stock sold for more than eighty dollars.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Enron will continue to try to <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#do business">do business</a>
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#with the aid of">with the aid of</a> court protection.
However Enron has already <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#dismiss">dismissed</a> four-thousand of its more than twenty-one-thousand workers.
Most of those dismissed were employees that worked at the company's
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#headquarter">headquarters</a> in the western city of Houston, Texas.
Last week, Enron dismissed about one-thousand-one-hundred employees in Europe.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">These actions caused anger among the workers because the company's
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#retirement">retirement plan</a> had already lost more than one-thousand-million dollars.
Many employees not only lost their jobs, but also lost the money they had
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#invest">invested</a> in the company as part of their retirement plan.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Reports say the United States Justice Department has begun a
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#criminal">criminal</a> investigation into the company's activities.
The Labor Department says it is examining the company's dealings with the employees' retirement plan.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#Security and Exchange Commission">Security and Exchange Commission</a> already is investigating Enron's finances.
And <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#congressional">Congressional</a> committees have announced they will
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#hold hearings">hold hearings</a> to investigate the failure of Enron and the investment actions of the company's senior officials.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Enron <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#corporation">Corporation</a> has brought legal
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#charge">charges</a> against the Dynegy Company.
Enron says Dynegy had agreed to <a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#link with">link with</a> Enron.
Enron says this would have saved it.
Enron says the Dynegy Company refused to
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#honor a business agreement">honor a legal business agreement</a>.
Enron is asking the court to force Dynegy to pay ten thousand million dollars
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#in damages">in damages</a>. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Enron Corporation once was the world's largest energy trader.
Its failure is affecting energy markets in many countries including Germany, Britain and India.
Reports say companies and banks that have lent money to Enron could lose at least five-thousand-million dollars.
Experts say what caused Enron to fail will be the
<a target="bottom" href="0030-4.htm#subject">subject</a> of legal questions and court actions for many months to come.
