<H1>Marconi and the Radio</H1>
<p>Read this, then answer the questions at the bottom of the page. </p>
</CENTER><P>Guglielmo Marconi was born in Italy in 1874. He studied in Bologna and
since his childhood, he showed great interest in physics and electricity.
Basing his studies on Hertz's findings, Marconi concluded that the electromagnetic
waves could transmit messages, so he conducted his research in that direction.<P>As Marconi did not get any financial incentives from the Italian government,
he moved to England where he got funds for his research.<P>In 1897, Marconi was able to communicate via radio through the Bristol Channel.
In 1901, he transmitted long-wave radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, Marconi was already recognized as a great name in science and technology.<P>In 1909, he shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun, a German physicist, who
worked on wireless telegraphy and cathode rays.<P>Marconi died in 1937.
