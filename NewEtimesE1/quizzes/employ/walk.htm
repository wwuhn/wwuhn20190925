<P>When a business has a job opening, this business is looking for a new worker. Many businesses put "Help Wanted" signs in the window when they have job openings. When you see "Help Wanted" signs, you can go into companies and ask about jobs. This is called "walking in." Sometimes companies have job openings, but they don't put up signs. You can walk into these companies and ask about jobs. When you walk into a company, the first person you talk to is usually the receptionist or another employee. Later, you can sometimes talk to the manager. <HR>
