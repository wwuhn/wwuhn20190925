<P>Want ads are messages in the newspaper where you can find out about many different things. They are also known as the classified advertising section and you can find out about job openings there. The "Help Wanted" section is a part of the newspaper with want ads placed by people who have jobs to fill. After you find the "Help Wanted" or "Employment" section, you will see other titles under these general titles. They are called subheadings. For example, you can look under the subheading "Office" or "Clerical" if you have special skills as a secretary or typist. The jobs are listed in alphabetical order under the subheadings.
<P>You can read the want ads to learn general information about available jobs or to learn specific information about a particular job that interests you. Reading the want ads will help you better understand the jobs that are available. However, only a small group of people get jobs through the want ads. Often the jobs offered are entry level jobs or beginning jobs. If you have little experience as a worker, want ads may help you find the job you looking for. <CENTER><HR>
