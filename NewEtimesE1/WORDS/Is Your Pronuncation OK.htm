        <font face="Georgia" size="4">Dearest creature in creation,&nbsp;
        <br>
        Studying English pronunciation, <br>
        I will teach you in my verse, <br>
        Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse- <br>
        It will keep you, Susy, busy; <br>
        Make your head with heat grow dizzy; <br>
        Tear in eye your dress you'll tear- <br>
        So shall I. Oh hear my prayer. <br>
        Pray console your loving poet, <br>
        Make my coat look new, dear, sew it.<br>
        Just compare heart, beard and heard, <br>
        Dies and diet, lord and word, <br>
        Sword and sward, retain and Britain. <br>
        (Mind the latter, how it's written). <br>
        Made has not the sound of bade, <br>
        Say - said, pay - paid, laid, but plaid. <br>
        Now I surely will not plague you <br>
        with such words as vague and ague, <br>
        But be careful how you speak, <br>
        Say break, steak, but bleak and streak.<br>
        Previous, precious; fuchsia, via; <br>
        Pipe, snipe, recipe and choir; <br>
        Cloven, oven; how and low; <br>
        Script, receipt; shoe, poem, toe, <br>
        Hear me say, devoid of trickery: <br>
        Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore; <br>
        Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles; <br>
        Exiles, similes, reviles; <br>
        Wholly, holly, signal, signing; <br>
        Thames, examining, combining.<br>
        Scholar, vicar and cigar; <br>
        Solar, mica, war and far; <br>
        From desire-desirable; admirable from admire; <br>
        Lumber, plumber; bier but brier; <br>
        Chatham, brougham; renown but known; <br>
        Knowledge, done but gone and tone; <br>
        One, anemone, Balmoral; <br>
        Kitchen, lichen; laundry, laurel; <br>
        Gertrude, German; wind and mind; <br>
        Scene, Melpomene; mankind; <br>
        Tortoise, turquoise, chamois - leather; <br>
        Reading, reading, heathen, heather.<br>
        This phonetic labyrinth <br>
        Gives moss, gross, brook, brooch, <br>
        ninth and plinth. <br>
        Billet does not end like ballet; <br>
        Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet. <br>
        Blood and flood are not like food,&nbsp; <br>
        nor is mould like would and should. <br>
        Banquet is not nearly parquet, <br>
        Which is said to rhyme with &quot;darky&quot;, <br>
        Viscous, viscount; load and broad; <br>
        Toward, to forward, to reward.<br>
        And your pronunciation's &quot;O.K.&quot; <br>
        When you say correctly croquet; <br>
        Rounded, wounded; grieve and sieve; <br>
        friend and fiend; alive and live; <br>
        Liberty, library, heave and heaven; <br>
        Rachel, ache, moustache; eleven. <br>
        We say hallowed, but allowed; <br>
        People, leopard; towed but vowed.<br>
        Mark the difference, moreover, <br>
        Between mover, plover, Dover, <br>
        Leeches, breeches, wise, precise; <br>
        Chalice, but police and lice; <br>
        Camel, constable, unstable; <br>
        Principle, disciple, label; <br>
        Petal, penal and canal; <br>
        Wait, surmise, plait, promise, pal. <br>
        Suit, suite, ruin; circuit, conduit <br>
        Rhyme with &quot;shirk it&quot; and &quot;beyond it&quot;, <br>
        But it is not hard to tell, <br>
        Why it's pall-mall, but Pall Mall.<br>
        Muscle, muscular; gaol; iron; <br>
        Timber, climber; bullion, lion; <br>
        Worm and storm; chaise, chaos, chair; <br>
        Senator, spectator, mayor. <br>
        Ivy, privy; famous; clamour <br>
        and enamour rhyme with hammer.<br>
        Pussy, hussy and possess, <br>
        desert, but dessert, address. <br>
        Golf, wolf; countenance; lieutenants <br>
        Hoist, in lieu of flags, left pennants. <br>
        River, rival; tomb, bomb, comb; <br>
        Doll and roll and some and home. <br>
        Stranger does not rhyme with anger, <br>
        neither does devour with clangour. <br>
        Soul but foul, and gaunt, but aunt; <br>
        Font, front, wont, want, grand and grant.<br>
        Shoes, goes, does. Now first say: finger, <br>
        And then: singer, ginger, linger. <br>
        Real, zeal; mauve, gauze and gauge; <br>
        marriage, foliage, mirage and age. <br>
        Query does not rhyme with very, <br>
        Nor does fury sound like bury. <br>
        Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth; <br>
        Job, job, blossom, bosom, oath. <br>
        Though the difference seems little, <br>
        We say actual, but victual.<br>
        Seat , sweat; chaste, caste; Leigh, eight, height; <br>
        Put, nut; granite but unite. <br>
        Reefer does not rhyme with &quot;deafer&quot;. <br>
        Feoffor does, and zephyr, heifer. <br>
        Dull, bull; Geoffrey, George; ate, late; <br>
        Hint, pint; senate, but sedate; <br>
        Scenic, Arabic, pacific. <br>
        Science, conscience, scientific; <br>
        Tour, but our, and succour, four; <br>
        Gas, alas and Arcansas. <br>
        Sea, idea, guinea, area. <br>
        Psalm; but malaria, <br>
        Youth, south, southern; cleanse, but clean; <br>
        Doctrine, turpentine, marine, <br>
        Compare alien with Italian, <br>
        Dandelion with battalion, <br>
        Sally with ally, yea, ye <br>
        Eye, I, oy, aye. Whey, key, quay.<br>
        Say aver, but ever, fever, <br>
        Neither, leisure, skein, receiver, <br>
        Never guess - it's not safe. <br>
        We say calves, valves, half, but Ralf. <br>
        Heron, granary, canary; <br>
        Crevice and device and eyrie; <br>
        Face but preface, but efface; <br>
        Phlegm, phlegmatic; ass, glass bass; <br>
        Large, but target, gin, give, verging, <br>
        Ought, out, joust and scour, but scourging, <br>
        War, earn; and wear and tear <br>
        do not rhyme with &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot; but &quot;ere&quot;.<br>
        Sever is right, but so is even; <br>
        Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen; <br>
        Monkey, donkey; clerk and jerk; <br>
        Asp, grasp, wasp; and cork and work.<br>
        Pronunciation- think of Psyche - <br>
        Is a paling, stout and spiky, <br>
        Won't it make you lose your wits, <br>
        Writing &quot;groats&quot; and saying &quot;grits&quot;. <br>
        It's a dark abyss, or tunnel, <br>
        strewn with stones, like rowlock, gunwale <br>
        Islington and Isle of Wight, <br>
        Housewife, verdict and indict.<br>
        Don't you think so, reader, rather <br>
        Saying lather, bather, father? <br>
        Finally: which rhymes with &quot;enough&quot; <br>
        Though, through, plough, cough, rough, or tough? <br>
        Hiccough has the sound of &quot;cup&quot;. <br>
        My advice is-give it up!!!</font></span></h2>

        And it's not just pronunciation that makes English so difficult when:
        <br>
        A bum in the USA is a tramp, a bum in Britain is something 
        unmentionable, a fanny in the USA is a behind, while a fanny in Britain 
        is even more unmentionable.&nbsp; <br>
