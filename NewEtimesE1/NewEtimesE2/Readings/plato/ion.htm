      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES; ION&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Socrates. Welcome, Ion. Are you from your native city of Ephesus? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No, Socrates; but from Epidaurus, where I attended the festival of 
      Asclepius. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And do the Epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the festival?
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. O yes; and of all sorts of musical performers. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And were you one of the competitors- and did you succeed? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. I obtained the first prize of all, Socrates. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Well done; and I hope that you will do the same for us at the 
      Panathenaea. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. And I will, please heaven. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. I often envy the profession of a rhapsode, Ion; for you have always 
      to wear fine clothes, and to look as beautiful as you can is a part of 
      your art. Then, again, you are obliged to be continually in the company of 
      many good poets; and especially of Homer, who is the best and most divine 
      of them; and to understand him, and not merely learn his words by rote, is 
      a thing greatly to be envied. And no man can be a rhapsode who does not 
      understand the meaning of the poet. For the rhapsode ought to interpret 
      the mind of the poet to his hearers, but how can he interpret him well 
      unless he knows what he means? All this is greatly to be envied. </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Very true, Socrates; interpretation has certainly been the most 
      laborious part of my art; and I believe myself able to speak about Homer 
      better than any man; and that neither Metrodorus of Lampsacus, nor 
      Stesimbrotus of Thasos, nor Glaucon, nor any one else who ever was, had as 
      good ideas about Homer as I have, or as many. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. I am glad to hear you say so, Ion; I see that you will not refuse to 
      acquaint me with them. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Certainly, Socrates; and you really ought to hear how exquisitely I 
      render Homer. I think that the Homeridae should give me a golden crown.
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. I shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of him at 
      some other time. But just now I should like to ask you a question: Does 
      your art extend to Hesiod and Archilochus, or to Homer only? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. To Homer only; he is in himself quite enough. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Are there any things about which Homer and Hesiod agree? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes; in my opinion there are a good many. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And can you interpret better what Homer says, or what Hesiod says, 
      about these matters in which they agree? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. I can interpret them equally well, Socrates, where they agree. </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. But what about matters in which they do not agree?- for example, 
      about divination, of which both Homer and Hesiod have something to say-
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Very true: </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what these two 
      poets say about divination, not only when they agree, but when they 
      disagree? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Ion. A prophet. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And if you were a prophet, would you be able to interpret them when 
      they disagree as well as when they agree? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Clearly. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. But how did you come to have this skill about Homer only, and not 
      about Hesiod or the other poets? Does not Homer speak of the same themes 
      which all other poets handle? Is not war his great argument? and does he 
      not speak of human society and of intercourse of men, good and bad, 
      skilled and unskilled, and of the gods conversing with one another and 
      with mankind, and about what happens in heaven and in the world below, and 
      the generations of gods and heroes? Are not these the themes of which 
      Homer sings? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Very true, Socrates. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And do not the other poets sing of the same? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes, Socrates; but not in the same way as Homer. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. What, in a worse way? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes, in a far worse. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And Homer in a better way? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. He is incomparably better. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And yet surely, my dear friend Ion, in a discussion about arithmetic, 
      where many people are speaking, and one speaks better than the rest, there 
      is somebody who can judge which of them is the good speaker? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And he who judges of the good will be the same as he who judges of 
      the bad speakers? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. The same. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And he will be the arithmetician? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Well, and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food, when many 
      persons are speaking, and one speaks better than the rest, will he who 
      recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him who 
      recognizes the worse, or the same? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Clearly the same. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And who is he, and what is his name? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. The physician. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And speaking generally, in all discussions in which the subject is 
      the same and many men are speaking, will not he who knows the good know 
      the bad speaker also? For if he does not know the bad, neither will he 
      know the good when the same topic is being discussed. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. True. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Is not the same person skilful in both? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And you say that Homer and the other poets, such as Hesiod and 
      Archilochus, speak of the same things, although not in the same way; but 
      the one speaks well and the other not so well? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes; and I am right in saying so. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And if you knew the good speaker, you would also know the inferior 
      speakers to be inferior? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. That is true. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Then, my dear friend, can I be mistaken in saying that Ion is equally 
      skilled in Homer and in other poets, since he himself acknowledges that 
      the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the same 
      things; and that almost all poets do speak of the same things? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Why then, Socrates, do I lose attention and go to sleep and have 
      absolutely no ideas of the least value, when any one speaks of any other 
      poet; but when Homer is mentioned, I wake up at once and am all attention 
      and have plenty to say? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. The reason, my friend, is obvious. No one can fail to see that you 
      speak of Homer without any art or knowledge. If you were able to speak of 
      him by rules of art, you would have been able to speak of all other poets; 
      for poetry is a whole. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And when any one acquires any other art as a whole, the same may be 
      said of them. Would you like me to explain my meaning, Ion? </span></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes, indeed, Socrates; I very much wish that you would: for I love to 
      hear you wise men talk. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. O that we were wise, Ion, and that you could truly call us so; but 
      you rhapsodes and actors, and the poets whose verses you sing, are wise; 
      whereas I am a common man, who only speak the truth. For consider what a 
      very commonplace and trivial thing is this which I have said- a thing 
      which any man might say: that when a man has acquired a knowledge of a 
      whole art, the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same. Let us 
      consider this matter; is not the art of painting a whole? </span></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And there are and have been many painters good and bad? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out the 
      excellences and defects of Polygnotus the son of Aglaophon, but incapable 
      of criticizing other painters; and when the work of any other painter was 
      produced, went to sleep and was at a loss, and had no ideas; but when he 
      had to give his opinion about Polygnotus, or whoever the painter might be, 
      and about him only, woke up and was attentive and had plenty to say?
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No indeed, I have never known such a person. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Or did you ever know of any one in sculpture, who was skilful in 
      expounding the merits of Daedalus the son of Metion, or of Epeius the son 
      of Panopeus, or of Theodorus the Samian, or of any individual sculptor; 
      but when the works of sculptors in general were produced, was at a loss 
      and went to sleep and had nothing to say? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No indeed; no more than the other. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And if I am not mistaken, you never met with any one among 
      flute-players or harp- players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who was 
      able to discourse of Olympus or Thamyras or Orpheus, or Phemius the 
      rhapsode of Ithaca, but was at a loss when he came to speak of Ion of 
      Ephesus, and had no notion of his merits or defects? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. I cannot deny what you say, Socrates. Nevertheless I am conscious in 
      my own self, and the world agrees with me in thinking that I do speak 
      better and have more to say about Homer than any other man. But I do not 
      speak equally well about others- tell me the reason of this. </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. I perceive, Ion; and I will proceed to explain to you what I imagine 
      to be the reason of this. The gift which you possess of speaking 
      excellently about Homer is not an art, but, as I was just saying, an 
      inspiration; there is a divinity moving you, like that contained in the 
      stone which Euripides calls a magnet, but which is commonly known as the 
      stone of Heraclea. This stone not only attracts iron rings, but also 
      imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings; and sometimes 
      you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one 
      another so as to form quite a long chain: and all of them derive their 
      power of suspension from the original stone. In like manner the Muse first 
      of all inspires men herself; and from these inspired persons a chain of 
      other persons is suspended, who take the inspiration. For all good poets, 
      epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful poems not by art, but 
      because they are inspired and possessed. And as the Corybantian revellers 
      when they dance are not in their right mind, so the lyric poets are not in 
      their right mind when they are composing their beautiful strains: but when 
      falling under the power of music and metre they are inspired and 
      possessed; like Bacchic maidens who draw milk and honey from the rivers 
      when they are under the influence of Dionysus but not when they are in 
      their right mind. And the soul of the lyric poet does the same, as they 
      themselves say; for they tell us that they bring songs from honeyed 
      fountains, culling them out of the gardens and dells of the Muses; they, 
      like the bees, winging their way from flower to flower. And this is true. 
      For the poet is a light and winged and holy thing, and there is no 
      invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses, and 
      the mind is no longer in him: when he has not attained to this state, he 
      is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the actions of 
      men; but like yourself when speaking about Homer, they do not speak of 
      them by any rules of art: they are simply inspired to utter that to which 
      the Muse impels them, and that only; and when inspired, one of them will 
      make dithyrambs, another hymns of praise, another choral strains, another 
      epic or iambic verses- and he who is good at one is not good any other 
      kind of verse: for not by art does the poet sing, but by power divine. Had 
      he learned by rules of art, he would have known how to speak not of one 
      theme only, but of all; and therefore God takes away the minds of poets, 
      and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and holy 
      prophets, in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not 
      of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of 
      unconsciousness, but that God himself is the speaker, and that through 
      them he is conversing with us. And Tynnichus the Chalcidian affords a 
      striking instance of what I am saying: he wrote nothing that any one would 
      care to remember but the famous paean which; in every one's mouth, one of 
      the finest poems ever written, simply an invention of the Muses, as he 
      himself says. For in this way, the God would seem to indicate to us and 
      not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are not human, or the 
      work of man, but divine and the work of God; and that the poets are only 
      the interpreters of the Gods by whom they are severally possessed. Was not 
      this the lesson which the God intended to teach when by the mouth of the 
      worst of poets he sang the best of songs? Am I not right, Ion? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes, indeed, Socrates, I feel that you are; for your words touch my 
      soul, and I am persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration interpret 
      the things of the Gods to us. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets? </span></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. There again you are right. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Then you are the interpreters of interpreters? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Precisely. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. I wish you would frankly tell me, Ion, what I am going to ask of you: 
      When you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in the recitation 
      of some striking passage, such as the apparition of Odysseus leaping forth 
      on the floor, recognized by the suitors and casting his arrows at his 
      feet, or the description of Achilles rushing at Hector, or the sorrows of 
      Andromache, Hecuba, or Priam,- are you in your right mind? Are you not 
      carried out of yourself, and does not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be 
      among the persons or places of which you are speaking, whether they are in 
      Ithaca or in Troy or whatever may be the scene of the poem? </span></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. That proof strikes home to me, Socrates. For I must frankly confess 
      that at the tale of pity, my eyes are filled with tears, and when I speak 
      of horrors, my hair stands on end and my heart throbs. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Well, Ion, and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice or 
      festival, when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden crowns upon 
      his head, of which nobody has robbed him, appears sweeping or 
      panic-stricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly 
      faces, when there is no one despoiling or wronging him;- is he in his 
      right mind or is he not? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No indeed, Socrates, I must say that, strictly speaking, he is not in 
      his right mind. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And are you aware that you produce similar effects on most 
      spectators? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Only too well; for I look down upon them from the stage, and behold 
      the various emotions of pity, wonder, sternness, stamped upon their 
      countenances when I am speaking: and I am obliged to give my very best 
      attention to them; for if I make them cry I myself shall laugh, and if I 
      make them laugh I myself shall cry when the time of payment arrives.
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings which, as I 
      am saying, receive the power of the original magnet from one another? The 
      rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links, and the poet 
      himself is the first of them. Through all these the God sways the souls of 
      men in any direction which he pleases, and makes one man hang down from 
      another. Thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and 
      undermasters of choruses, who are suspended, as if from the stone, at the 
      side of the rings which hang down from the Muse. And every poet has some 
      Muse from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is said to be possessed, 
      which is nearly the same thing; for he is taken hold of. And from these 
      first rings, which are the poets, depend others, some deriving their 
      inspiration from Orpheus, others from Musaeus; but the greater number are 
      possessed and held by Homer. Of whom, Ion, you are one, and are possessed 
      by Homer; and when any one repeats the words of another poet you go to 
      sleep, and know not what to say; but when any one recites a strain of 
      Homer you wake up in a moment, and your soul leaps within you, and you 
      have plenty to say; for not by art or knowledge about Homer do you say 
      what you say, but by divine inspiration and by possession; just as the 
      Corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of that strain only 
      which is appropriated to the God by whom they are possessed, and have 
      plenty of dances and words for that, but take no heed of any other. And 
      you, Ion, when the name of Homer is mentioned have plenty to say, and have 
      nothing to say of others. You ask, &quot;Why is this?&quot; The answer is that you 
      praise Homer not by art but by divine inspiration. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. That is good, Socrates; and yet I doubt whether you will ever have 
      eloquence enough to persuade me that I praise Homer only when I am mad and 
      possessed; and if you could hear me speak of him I am sure you would never 
      think this to be the case. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. I should like very much to hear you, but not until you have answered 
      a question which I have to ask. On what part of Homer do you speak well?- 
      not surely about every part. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ion. There is no part, Socrates, about which I do not speak well of 
      that I can assure you. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Surely not about things in Homer of which you have no knowledge?
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. And what is there in Homer of which I have no knowledge? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Why, does not Homer speak in many passages about arts? For example, 
      about driving; if I can only remember the lines I will repeat them. </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. I remember, and will repeat them. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Tell me then, what Nestor says to Antilochus, his son, where he bids 
      him be careful of the turn at the horse-race in honour of Patroclus.
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. He says:&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them, and urge the 
      horse on the right hand with whip and voice; and slacken the rein. And 
      when you are at the goal, let the left horse draw near, yet so that the 
      nave of the well-wrought wheel may not even seem to touch the extremity; 
      and avoid catching the stone.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Enough. Now, Ion, will the charioteer or the physician be the better 
      judge of the propriety of these lines? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. The charioteer, clearly. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And will the reason be that this is his art, or will there be any 
      other reason? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No, that will be the reason. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And every art is appointed by God to have knowledge of a certain 
      work; for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not know by the 
      art of medicine? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Certainly not. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know by the 
      art of medicine? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Certainly not. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And this is true of all the arts;- that which we know with one art we 
      do not know with the other? But let me ask a prior question: You admit 
      that there are differences of arts? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. You would argue, as I should, that when one art is of one kind of 
      knowledge and another of another, they are different? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Yes, surely; for if the subject of knowledge were the same, there 
      would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different,- if they both 
      gave the same knowledge. For example, I know that here are five fingers, 
      and you know the same. And if I were to ask whether I and you became 
      acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of arithmetic, you 
      would acknowledge that we did? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Tell me, then, what I was intending to ask you- whether this holds 
      universally? Must the same art have the same subject of knowledge, and 
      different arts other subjects of knowledge? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. That is my opinion, Socrates. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no right 
      judgment of the sayings and doings of that art? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Very true. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were 
      reciting from Homer, you or the charioteer? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. The charioteer. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Why, yes, because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer. </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the charioteer?
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And if a different knowledge, then a knowledge of different matters?
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. True. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. You know the passage in which Hecamede, the concubine of Nestor, is 
      described as giving to the wounded Machaon a posset, as he says,&nbsp; </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Made with Pramnian wine; and she grated cheese of goat's milk with a 
      grater of bronze, and at his side placed an onion which gives a relish to 
      drink.&nbsp; Now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of 
      medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. The art of medicine. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And when Homer says,&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      And she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet, which, set in the 
      horn of ox that ranges in the fields, rushes along carrying death among 
      the ravenous fishes,-&nbsp; will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be 
      better able to judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not?
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Clearly, Socrates, the art of the fisherman. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Come now, suppose that you were to say to me: &quot;Since you, Socrates, 
      are able to assign different passages in Homer to their corresponding 
      arts, I wish that you would tell me what are the passages of which the 
      excellence ought to be judged by the prophet and prophetic art&quot;; and you 
      will see how readily and truly I shall answer you. For there are many such 
      passages, particularly in the Odyssey; as, for example, the passage in 
      which Theoclymenus the prophet of the house of Melampus says to the 
      suitors:-&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Wretched men! what is happening to you? Your heads and your faces and your 
      limbs underneath are shrouded in night; and the voice of lamentation 
      bursts forth, and your cheeks are wet with tears. And the vestibule is 
      full, and the court is full, of ghosts descending into the darkness of 
      Erebus, and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an evil mist is spread 
      abroad.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      And there are many such passages in the Iliad also; as for example in the 
      description of the battle near the rampart, where he says:-&nbsp; </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      As they were eager to pass the ditch, there came to them an omen: a 
      soaring eagle, holding back the people on the left, bore a huge bloody 
      dragon in his talons, still living and panting; nor had he yet resigned 
      the strife, for he bent back and smote the bird which carried him on the 
      breast by the neck, and he in pain let him fall from him to the ground 
      into the midst of the multitude. And the eagle, with a cry, was borne afar 
      on the wings of the wind.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      These are the sort of things which I should say that the prophet ought to 
      consider and determine. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. And you are quite right, Socrates, in saying so. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Yes, Ion, and you are right also. And as I have selected from the 
      Iliad and Odyssey for you passages which describe the office of the 
      prophet and the physician and the fisherman, do you, who know Homer so 
      much better than I do, Ion, select for me passages which relate to the 
      rhapsode and the rhapsode's art, and which the rhapsode ought to examine 
      and judge of better than other men. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. All passages, I should say, Socrates. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Not all, Ion, surely. Have you already forgotten what you were 
      saying? A rhapsode ought to have a better memory. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Why, what am I forgetting? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode to be 
      different from the art of the charioteer? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes, I remember. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And you admitted that being different they would have different 
      subjects of knowledge? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Then upon your own showing the rhapsode, and the art of the rhapsode, 
      will not know everything? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. I should exclude certain things, Socrates. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. You mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the subjects of 
      the other arts. As he does not know all of them, which of them will he 
      know? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. He will know what a man and what a woman ought to say, and what a 
      freeman and what a slave ought to say, and what a ruler and what a 
      subject. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot what the 
      ruler of a sea-tossed vessel ought to say? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No; the pilot will know best. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the ruler of 
      a sick man ought to say? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. He will not. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. But he will know what a slave ought to say? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Suppose the slave to be a cowherd; the rhapsode will know better than 
      the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the infuriated cows?
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No, he will not. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. But he will know what a spinning-woman ought to say about the working 
      of wool? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. At any rate he will know what a general ought to say when exhorting 
      his soldiers? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes, that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be sure to 
      know. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Well, but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. I am sure that I should know what a general ought to say. </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Why, yes, Ion, because you may possibly have a knowledge of the art 
      of the general as well as of the rhapsode; and you may also have a 
      knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre: and then you would know 
      when horses were well or ill managed. But suppose I were to ask you: By 
      the help of which art, Ion, do you know whether horses are well managed, 
      by your skill as a horseman or as a performer on the lyre- what would you 
      answer? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. I should reply, by my skill as a horseman. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And if you judged of performers on the lyre, you would admit that you 
      judged of them as a performer on the lyre, and not as a horseman? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And in judging of the general's art, do you judge of it as a general 
      or a rhapsode? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. To me there appears to be no difference between them. </span></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. What do you mean? Do you mean to say that the art of the rhapsode and 
      of the general is the same? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Yes, one and the same. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general? </span></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Certainly, Socrates. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode? </span></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. No; I do not say that. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. But you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general.
      </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Certainly. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And you are the best of Hellenic rhapsodes? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Far the best, Socrates. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. And are you the best general, Ion? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. To be sure, Socrates; and Homer was my master. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. But then, Ion, what in the name of goodness can be the reason why 
      you, who are the best of generals as well as the best of rhapsodes in all 
      Hellas, go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general? Do you think 
      that the Hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown, and do not want a 
      general? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Why, Socrates, the reason is, that my countrymen, the Ephesians, are 
      the servants and soldiers of Athens, and do not need a general; and you 
      and Sparta are not likely to have me, for you think that you have enough 
      generals of your own. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. My good Ion, did you never hear of Apollodorus of Cyzicus? </span>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. Who may he be? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. One who, though a foreigner, has often been chosen their general by 
      the Athenians: and there is Phanosthenes of Andros, and Heraclides of 
      Clazomenae, whom they have also appointed to the command of their armies 
      and to other offices, although aliens, after they had shown their merit. 
      And will they not choose Ion the Ephesian to be their general, and honour 
      him, if he prove himself worthy? Were not the Ephesians originally 
      Athenians, and Ephesus is no mean city? But, indeed, Ion, if you are 
      correct in saying that by art and knowledge you are able to praise Homer, 
      you do not deal fairly with me, and after all your professions of knowing 
      many, glorious things about Homer, and promises that you would exhibit 
      them, you are only a deceiver, and so far from exhibiting the art of which 
      you are a master, will not, even after my repeated entreaties, explain to 
      me the nature of it. You have literally as many forms as Proteus; and now 
      you go all manner of ways, twisting and turning, and, like Proteus, become 
      all manner of people at once, and at last slip away from me in the 
      disguise of a general, in order that you may escape exhibiting your 
      Homeric lore. And if you have art, then, as I was saying, in falsifying 
      your promise that you would exhibit Homer, you are not dealing fairly with 
      me. But if, as I believe, you have no art, but speak all these beautiful 
      words about Homer unconsciously under his inspiring influence, then I 
      acquit you of dishonesty, and shall only say that you are inspired. Which 
      do you prefer to be thought, dishonest or inspired? </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Ion. There is a great difference, Socrates, between the two alternatives; 
      and inspiration is by far the nobler. </span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Soc. Then, Ion, I shall assume the nobler alternative; and attribute to 
      you in your praises of Homer inspiration, and not art.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font>
