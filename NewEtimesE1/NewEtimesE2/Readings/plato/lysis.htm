      LYSIS, OR FRIENDSHIP<br>
      by Plato<br>
      translated by Benjamin Jowett</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">
<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES, who is the narrator; 
MENEXENUS; HIPPOTHALES; LYSIS; CTESIPPUS. Scene: A newly-erected Palaestra 
outside the walls of Athens. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I was 
going from the Academy straight to the Lyceum, intending to take the outer road, 
which is close under the wall. When I came to the postern gate of the city, 
which is by the fountain of Panops, I fell in with Hippothales, the son of 
Hieronymus, and Ctesippus the Paeanian, and a company of young men who were 
standing with them. Hippothales, seeing me approach, asked whence I came and 
whither I was going.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am 
going, I replied, from the Academy straight to the Lyceum.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
come straight to us, he said, and put in here; you may as well.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Who 
are you, I said; and where am I to come?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
showed me an enclosed space and an open door over against the wall. And there, 
he said, is the building at which we all meet: and a goodly company we are.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
what is this building, I asked; and what sort of entertainment have you?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 
building, he replied, is a newly erected Palaestra; and the entertainment is 
generally conversation, to which you are welcome.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank 
you, I said; and is there any teacher there?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said, your old friend and admirer, Miccus.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Indeed, I replied; he is a very eminent professor.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are 
you disposed, he said, to go with me and see them?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I 
said; but I should like to know first, what is expected of me, and who is the 
favourite among you?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some 
persons have one favourite, Socrates, and some another, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
who is yours? I asked: tell me that, Hippothales.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At 
this he blushed; and I said to him, O Hippothales, thou son of Hieronymus! do 
not say that you are, or that you are not, in love; the confession is too late; 
for I see that you are not only in love, but are already far gone in your love. 
Simple and foolish as I am, the Gods have given me the power of understanding 
affections of this kind.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Whereupon he blushed more and more.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ctesippus 
said: I like to see you blushing, Hippothales, and hesitating to tell Socrates 
the name; when, if he were with you but for a very short time, you would have 
plagued him to death by talking about nothing else. Indeed, Socrates, he has 
literally deafened us, and stopped our ears with the praises of Lysis; and if he 
is a little intoxicated, there is every likelihood that we may have our sleep 
murdered with a cry of Lysis. His performances in prose are bad enough, but 
nothing at all in comparison with his verse; and when he drenches us with his 
poems and other compositions, it is really too bad; and worse still is his 
manner of singing them to his love; he has a voice which is truly appalling, and 
we cannot help hearing him: and now having a question put to him by you, behold 
he is blushing.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Who is 
Lysis? I said: I suppose that he must be young; for the name does not recall any 
one to me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why, 
he said, his father being a very well known man, he retains his patronymic, and 
is not as yet commonly called by his own name; but, although you do not know his 
name, I am sure that you must know his face, for that is quite enough to 
distinguish him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
tell me whose son he is, I said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He is 
the eldest son of Democrates, of the deme of Aexone.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ah, 
Hippothales, I said; what a noble and really perfect love you have found! I wish 
that you would favour me with the exhibition which you have been making to the 
rest of the company, and then I shall be able to judge whether you know what a 
lover ought to say about his love, either to the youth himself, or to others.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nay, 
Socrates, he said; you surely do not attach any importance to what he is saying.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you 
mean, I said, that you disown the love of the person whom he says that you love?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No; 
but I deny that I make verses or address compositions to him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He is 
not in his right mind, said Ctesippus; he is talking nonsense, and is stark mad.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;O 
Hippothales, I said, if you have ever made any verses or songs in honour of your 
favourite, I do not want to hear them; but I want to know the purport of them, 
that I may be able to judge of your mode of approaching your fair one.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ctesippus 
will be able to tell you, he said; for if, as he avers, the sound of my words is 
always dinning in his ears, he must have a very accurate knowledge and 
recollection of them.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
indeed, said Ctesippus; I know only too well; and very ridiculous the tale is: 
for although he is a lover, and very devotedly in love, he has nothing 
particular to talk about to his beloved which a child might not say. Now is not 
that ridiculous? He can only speak of the wealth of Democrates, which the whole 
city celebrates, and grandfather Lysis, and the other ancestors of the youth, 
and their stud of horses, and their victory at the Pythian games, and at the 
Isthmus, and at Nemea with four horses and single horses-these are the tales 
which he composes and repeats. And there is greater twaddle still. Only the day 
before yesterday he made a poem in which he described the entertainment of 
Heracles, who was a connexion of the family, setting forth how in virtue of this 
relationship he was hospitably received by an ancestor of Lysis; this ancestor 
was himself begotten of Zeus by the daughter of the founder of the deme. And 
these are the sort of old wives' tales which he sings and recites to us, and we 
are obliged to listen to him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I 
heard this, I said: O ridiculous Hippothales! how can you be making and singing 
hymns in honour of yourself before you have won?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But my 
songs and verses, he said, are not in honour of myself, Socrates.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You 
think not? I said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nay, 
but what do you think? he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most 
assuredly, I said, those songs are all in your own honour; for if you win your 
beautiful love, your discourses and songs will be a glory, to you, and may be 
truly regarded as hymns of praise composed in honour of you who have conquered 
and won such a love; but if he slips away from you, the more you have praised 
him, the more ridiculous you will look at having lost this fairest and best of 
blessings; and therefore the wise lover does not praise his beloved until he has 
won him, because he is afraid of accidents. There is also another danger; the 
fair, when any one praises or magnifies them, are filled with the spirit of 
pride and vain-glory. Do you not agree with me?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
the more vain-glorious they are, the more difficult is the capture of them?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
believe you.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What 
should you say of a hunter who frightened away his prey, and made the capture of 
the animals which he is hunting more difficult?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
would be a bad hunter, undoubtedly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes; 
and if, instead of soothing them, he were to infuriate them with words and 
songs, that would show a great want of wit: do you not agree.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
now reflect, Hippothales, and see whether you are not guilty of all these errors 
in writing poetry. For I can hardly suppose that you will affirm a man to be a 
good poet who injures himself by his poetry.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Assuredly not, he said; such a poet would be a fool. And this is the reason why 
I take you into my counsels, Socrates, and I shall be glad of any further advice 
which you may have to offer. Will you tell me by what words or actions I may 
become endeared to my love?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is not easy to determine, I said; but if you will bring your love to me, and 
will let me talk with him, I may perhaps be able to show you how to converse 
with him, instead of singing and reciting in the fashion of which you are 
accused.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There 
will be no difficulty in bringing him, he replied; if you will only go with 
Ctesippus into the Palaestra, and sit down and talk, I believe that he will come 
of his own accord; for he is fond of listening, Socrates. And as this is the 
festival of the Hermaea, the young men and boys are all together, and there is 
no separation between them. He will be sure to come: but if he does not, 
Ctesippus with whom he is familiar, and whose relation Menexenus is his great 
friend, shall call him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
will be the way, I said. Thereupon I led Ctesippus into the Palaestra, and the 
rest followed.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upon 
entering we found that the boys had just been sacrificing; and this part of the 
festival was nearly at an end. They were all in their white array, and games at 
dice were going on among them. Most of them were in the outer court amusing 
themselves; but some were in a corner of the Apodyterium playing at odd and even 
with a number of dice, which they took out of little wicker baskets. There was 
also a circle of lookers-on; among them was Lysis. He was standing with the 
other boys and youths, having a crown upon his head, like a fair vision, and not 
less worthy of praise for his goodness than for his beauty. We left them, and 
went over to the opposite side of the room, where, finding a quiet place, we sat 
down; and then we began to talk. This attracted Lysis, who was constantly 
turning round to look at us -he was evidently wanting to come to us. For a time 
he hesitated and had not the courage to come alone; but first of all, his friend 
Menexenus, leaving his play, entered the Palaestra from the court, and when he 
saw Ctesippus and myself, was going to take a seat by us; and then Lysis, seeing 
him, followed, and sat down by his side; and the other boys joined. I should 
observe that Hippothales, when he saw the crowd, got behind them, where he 
thought that he would be out of sight of Lysis, lest he should anger him; and 
there he stood and listened.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
turned to Menexenus, and said: Son of Demophon, which of you two youths is the 
elder?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is a matter of dispute between us, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
which is the nobler? Is that also a matter of dispute?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
another disputed point is, which is the fairer?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 
two boys laughed.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
shall not ask which is the richer of the two, I said; for you are friends, are 
you not?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly, they replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
friends have all things in common, so that one of you can be no richer than the 
other, if you say truly that you are friends.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
assented. I was about to ask which was the juster of the two, and which was the 
wiser of the two; but at this moment Menexenus was called away by some one who 
came and said that the gymnastic-master wanted him. I supposed that he had to 
offer sacrifice. So he went away, and I asked Lysis some more questions. I dare 
say, Lysis, I said, that your father and mother love you very much.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
they would wish you to be perfectly happy.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But do 
you think that any one is happy who is in the condition of a slave, and who 
cannot do what he likes?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
should think not indeed, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And if 
your father and mother love you, and desire that you should be happy, no one can 
doubt that they are very ready to promote your happiness.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And do 
they then permit you to do what you like, and never rebuke you or hinder you 
from doing what you desire?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
indeed, Socrates; there are a great many things which they hinder me from doing.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What 
do you mean? I said. Do they want you to be happy, and yet hinder you from doing 
what you like? For example, if you want to mount one of your father's chariots, 
and take the reins at a race, they will not allow you to do so-they will prevent 
you?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly, he said, they will not allow me to do so.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whom 
then will they allow?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There 
is a charioteer, whom my father pays for driving.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And do 
they trust a hireling more than you? and may he do what he likes with the 
horses? and do they pay him for this?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
do.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But I 
dare say that you may take the whip and guide the mule-cart if you like;-they 
will permit that?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Permit 
me! indeed they will not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, 
I said, may no one use the whip to the mules?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said, the muleteer.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And is 
he a slave or a free man?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A 
slave, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And do 
they esteem a slave of more value than you who are their son? And do they 
entrust their property to him rather than to you? and allow him to do what he 
likes, when they prohibit you? Answer me now: Are you your own master, or do 
they not even allow that?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nay, 
he said; of course they do not allow it.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
you have a master?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
my tutor; there he is.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And is 
he a slave?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be 
sure; he is our slave, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Surely, I said, this is a strange thing, that a free man should be governed by 
a slave. And what does he do with you?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
takes me to my teachers.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You do 
not mean to say that your teachers also rule over you?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Of 
course they do.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I 
must say that your father is pleased to inflict many lords and masters on you. 
But at any rate when you go home to your mother, she will let you have your own 
way, and will not interfere with your happiness; her wool, or the piece of cloth 
which she is weaving, are at your disposal: I am sure that there is nothing to 
hinder you from touching her wooden spathe, or her comb, or any other of her 
spinning implements.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nay, 
Socrates, he replied, laughing; not only does she hinder me, but I should be 
beaten if I were to touch one of them.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, 
I said, this is amazing. And did you ever behave ill to your father or your 
mother?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, 
indeed, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
why then are they so terribly anxious to prevent you from being happy, and doing 
as you like?-keeping you all day long in subjection to another, and, in a word, 
doing nothing which you desire; so that you have no good, as would appear, out 
of their great possessions, which are under the control of anybody rather than 
of you, and have no use of your own fair person, which is tended and taken care 
of by another; while you, Lysis, are master of nobody, and can do nothing?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why, 
he said, Socrates, the reason is that I am not of age.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
doubt whether that is the real reason, I said; for I should imagine that your 
father Democrates, and your mother, do permit you to do many things already, and 
do not wait until you are of age: for example, if they want anything read or 
written, you, I presume, would be the first person in the house who is summoned 
by them.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
you would be allowed to write or read the letters in any order which you please, 
or to take up the lyre and tune the notes, and play with the fingers, or strike 
with the plectrum, exactly as you please, and neither father nor mother would 
interfere with you.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is true, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
what can be the reason, Lysis, I said, why they allow you to do the one and not 
the other?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
suppose, he said, because I understand the one, and not the other.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
my dear youth, I said, the reason is not any deficiency of years, but a 
deficiency of knowledge; and whenever your father thinks that you are wiser than 
he is, he will instantly commit himself and his possessions to you.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
think so.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aye, I 
said; and about your neighbour, too, does not the same rule hold as about your 
father? If he is satisfied that you know more of housekeeping than he does, will 
he continue to administer his affairs himself, or will he commit them to you?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
think that he will commit them to me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Will 
not the Athenian people, too, entrust their affairs to you when they see that 
you have wisdom enough to manage them?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
oh! let me put another case, I said: There is the great king, and he has an 
eldest son, who is the Prince of Asia;-suppose that you and I go to him and 
establish to his satisfaction that we are better cooks than his son, will he not 
entrust to us the prerogative of making soup, and putting in anything that we 
like while the pot is boiling, rather than to the Prince of Asia, who is his 
son?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To us, 
clearly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And we 
shall be allowed to throw in salt by handfuls, whereas the son will not be 
allowed to put in as much as he can take up between his fingers?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Of 
course.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Or 
suppose again that the son has bad eyes, will he allow him, or will he not allow 
him, to touch his own eyes if he thinks that he has no knowledge of medicine?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
will not allow him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Whereas, if he supposes us to have a knowledge of medicine, he will allow us to 
do what we like with him-even to open the eyes wide and sprinkle ashes upon 
them, because he supposes that we know what is best?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
everything in which we appear to him to be wiser than himself or his son he will 
commit to us?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is very true, Socrates, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
now, my dear Lysis, I said, you perceive that in things which we know every one 
will trust us-Hellenes and barbarians, men and women-and we may do as we please 
about them, and no one will like to interfere with us; we shall be free, and 
masters of others; and these things will be really ours, for we shall be 
benefited by them. But in things of which we have no understanding, no one will 
trust us to do as seems good to us-they will hinder us as far as they can; and 
not only strangers, but father and mother, and the friend, if there be one, who 
is dearer still, will also hinder us; and we shall be subject to others; and 
these things will not be ours, for we shall not be benefited by them. Do you 
agree?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
assented.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
shall we be friends to others, and will any others love us, in as far as we are 
useless to them?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Neither can your father or mother love you, nor can anybody love anybody else, 
in so far as they are useless to them?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
therefore, my boy, if you are wise, -all men will be your friends and kindred, 
for you will be useful and good; but if you are not wise, neither father, nor 
mother, nor kindred, nor any one else, will be your friends. And in matters of 
which you have as yet no knowledge, can you have any conceit of knowledge?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is impossible, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
you, Lysis, if you require a teacher, have not yet attained to wisdom.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
therefore you are not conceited, having nothing of which to be conceited.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Indeed, Socrates, I think not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I 
heard him say this, I turned to Hippothales, and was very nearly making a 
blunder, for I was going to say to him: That is the way, Hippothales, in which 
you should talk to your beloved, humbling and lowering him, and not as you do, 
puffing him up and spoiling him. But I saw that he was in great excitement and 
confusion at what had been said, and I remembered that, although he was in the 
neighbourhood, he did not want to be seen by Lysis; so upon second thoughts I 
refrained.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the 
meantime Menexenus came back and sat down in his place by Lysis; and Lysis, in a 
childish and affectionate manner, whispered privately in my ear, so that 
Menexenus should not hear: Do, Socrates, tell Menexenus what you have been 
telling me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Suppose that you tell him yourself, Lysis, I replied; for I am sure that you 
were attending.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try, 
then, to remember the words, and be as exact as you can in repeating them to 
him, and if you have forgotten anything, ask me again the next time that you see 
me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will 
be sure to do so, Socrates; but go on telling him something new, and let me 
hear, as long as I am allowed to stay.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
certainly cannot refuse, I said, since you ask me; but then, as you know, 
Menexenus is very pugnacious, and therefore you must come to the rescue if he 
attempts to upset me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
indeed, he said; he is very pugnacious, and that is the reason why I want you to 
argue with him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That I 
may make a fool of myself?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, 
indeed, he said; but I want you to put him down.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is no easy matter, I replied; for he is a terrible fellow-a pupil of Ctesippus. 
And there is Ctesippus himself: do you see him?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Never 
mind, Socrates, you shall argue with him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, 
I suppose that I must, I replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Hereupon Ctesippus complained that we were talking in secret, and keeping the 
feast to ourselves.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
shall be happy, I said, to let you have a share. Here is Lysis, who does not 
understand something that I was saying, and wants me to ask Menexenus, who, as 
he thinks, is likely to know.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
why do you not ask him? he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
well, I said, I will; and do you, Menexenus, answer. But first I must tell you 
that I am one who from my childhood upward have set my heart upon a certain 
thing. All people have their fancies; some desire horses, and others dogs; and 
some are fond of gold, and others of honour. Now, I have no violent desire of 
any of these things; but I have a passion for friends; and I would rather have a 
good friend than the best cock or quail in the world: I would even go further, 
and say the best horse or dog. Yea, by the dog of Egypt, I should greatly prefer 
a real friend to all the gold of Darius, or even to Darius himself: I am such a 
lover of friends as that. And when I see you and Lysis, at your early age, so 
easily possessed of this treasure, and so soon, he of you, and you of him, I am 
amazed and delighted, seeing that I myself, although I am now advanced in years, 
am so far from having made a similar acquisition, that I do not even know in 
what way a friend is acquired. But want to ask you a question about this, for 
you have experience: tell me then, when one loves another, is the lover or the 
beloved the friend; or may either be the friend?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Either 
may, I should think, be the friend of either.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you 
mean, I said, that if only one of them loves the other, they are mutual friends?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said; that is my meaning.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
what if the lover is not loved in return? which is a very possible case.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Or is, 
perhaps, even hated? which is a fancy which sometimes is entertained by lovers 
respecting their beloved. Nothing can exceed their love; and yet they imagine 
either that they are not loved in return, or that they are hated. Is not that 
true?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said, quite true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 
that case, the one loves, and the other is loved?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
which is the friend of which? Is the lover the friend of the beloved, whether he 
be loved in return, or hated; or is the beloved the friend; or is there no 
friendship at all on either side, unless they both love one another?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There 
would seem to be none at all.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
this notion is not in accordance with our previous one. We were saying that both 
were friends, if one only loved; but now, unless they both love, neither is a 
friend.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
appears to be true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
nothing which does not love in return is beloved by a lover?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
think not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
they are not lovers of horses, whom the horses do not love in return; nor lovers 
of quails, nor of dogs, nor of wine, nor of gymnastic exercises, who have no 
return of love; no, nor of wisdom, unless wisdom loves them in return. Or shall 
we say that they do love them, although they are not beloved by them; and that 
the poet was wrong who sings- </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Happy 
the man to whom his children are dear, and steeds having single hoofs, and dogs 
of chase, and the stranger of another land? </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I do 
not think that he was wrong.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You 
think that he is right?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, 
Menexenus, the conclusion is, that what is beloved, whether loving or hating, 
may be dear to the lover of it: for example, very young children, too young to 
love, or even hating their father or mother when they are punished by them, are 
never dearer to them than at the time when they are being hated by them.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
think that what you say is true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, 
if so, not the lover, but the beloved, is the friend or dear one?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
the hated one, and not the hater, is the enemy?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Clearly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
many men are loved by their enemies, and hated by their friends, and are the 
friends of their enemies, and the enemies of their friends. Yet how absurd, my 
dear friend, or indeed impossible is this paradox of a man being an enemy to his 
friend or a friend to his enemy.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
quite agree, Socrates, in what you say.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But if 
this cannot be, the lover will be the friend of that which is loved?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
the hater will be the enemy of that which is hated?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet we 
must acknowledge in this, as in the preceding instance, that a man may be the 
friend of one who is not his friend, or who may be his enemy, when he loves that 
which does not love him or which even hates him. And he may be the enemy of one 
who is not his enemy, and is even his friend: for example, when he hates that 
which does not hate him, or which even loves him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
appears to be true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But if 
the lover is not a friend, nor the beloved a friend, nor both together, what are 
we to say? Whom are we to call friends to one another? Do any remain?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Indeed, Socrates, I cannot find any.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But, O 
Menexenus! I said, may we not have been altogether wrong in our conclusions?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am 
sure that we have been wrong, Socrates, said Lysis. And he blushed as he spoke, 
the words seeming to come from his lips involuntarily, because his whole mind 
was taken up with the argument; there was no mistaking his attentive look while 
he was listening.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I was 
pleased at the interest which was shown by Lysis, and I wanted to give Menexenus 
a rest, so I turned to him and said, I think, Lysis, that what you say is true, 
and that, if we had been right, we should never have gone so far wrong; let us 
proceed no further in this direction (for the road seems to be getting 
troublesome), but take the other path into which we turned, and see what the 
poets have to say; for they are to us in a manner the fathers and authors of 
wisdom, and they speak of friends in no light or trivial manner, but God 
himself, as they say, makes them and draws them to one another; and this they 
express, if I am not mistaken, in the following words:- </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is ever drawing like towards like, and</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making them acquainted. &nbsp;I 
dare say that you have heard those words.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said; I have.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
have you not also met with the treatises of philosophers who say that like must 
love like? they are the people who argue and write about nature and the 
universe.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
true, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
are they right in saying this?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
may be.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Perhaps, I said, about half, or possibly, altogether, right, if their meaning 
were rightly apprehended by us. For the more a bad man has to do with a bad man, 
and the more nearly he is brought into contact with him, the more he will be 
likely to hate him, for he injures him; and injurer and injured cannot be 
friends. Is not that true?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
one half of the saying is untrue, if the wicked are like one another?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
the real meaning of the saying, as I imagine, is, that, the good are like one 
another, friends to one another; and that the bad, as is often said of them, are 
never at unity with one another or with themselves; for they are passionate and 
restless, and anything which is at variance and enmity with itself is not likely 
to be in union or harmony with any other thing. Do you not agree?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I 
do.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, 
my friend, those who say that the like is friendly to the like mean to intimate, 
if I rightly apprehend them, that the good only is the friend of the good, and 
of him only; but that the evil never attains to any real friendship, either with 
good or evil. Do you agree?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
nodded assent.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
now we know how to answer the question &quot;Who are friends? for the argument 
declares &quot;That the good are friends.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
he said, that is true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I 
replied; and yet I am not quite satisfied with this answer. By heaven, and shall 
I tell you what I suspect? I will. Assuming that like, inasmuch as he is like, 
is the friend of like, and useful to him-or rather let me try another way of 
putting the matter: Can like do any good or harm to like which he could not do 
to himself, or suffer anything from his like which he would not suffer from 
himself? And if neither can be of any use to the other, how can they be loved by 
one another? Can they now?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
cannot.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
can he who is not loved be a friend?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
say that the like is not the friend of the like in so far as he is like; still 
the good may be the friend of the good in so far as he is good?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
then again, will not the good, in so far as he is good, be sufficient for 
himself? Certainly he will. And he who is sufficient wants nothing-that is 
implied in the word sufficient.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Of 
course not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And he 
who wants nothing will desire nothing?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
will not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Neither can he love that which he does not desire?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
cannot.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And he 
who not is not a lover of friend?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Clearly not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What 
place then is there for friendship, if, when absent, good men have no need of 
one another (for even when alone they are sufficient for themselves), and when 
present have no use of one another? How can such persons ever be induced to 
value one another?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
cannot.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
friends they cannot be, unless they value one another?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
see now, Lysis, whether we are not being deceived in all this-are we not indeed 
entirely wrong?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How 
so? he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I 
not heard some one say, as I just now recollect, that the like is the greatest 
enemy of the like, the good of the good?-Yes, and he quoted the authority of 
Hesiod, who says: </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potter quarrels with potter, hard with bard,</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggar with beggar; &nbsp;and of all other things he affirmed, in 
like manner, &quot;That of necessity the most like are most full of envy, strife, and 
hatred of one another, and the most unlike, of friendship. For the poor man is 
compelled to be the friend of the rich, and the weak requires the aid of the 
strong, and the sick man of the physician; and every one who is ignorant, has to 
love and court him who knows.&quot; And indeed he went on to say in grandiloquent 
language, that the idea of friendship existing between similars is not the 
truth, but the very reverse of the truth, and that the most opposed are the most 
friendly; for that everything desires not like but that which is most unlike: 
for example, the dry desires the moist, the cold the hot, the bitter the sweet, 
the sharp the blunt, the void the full, the full the void, and so of all other 
things; for the opposite is the food of the opposite, whereas like receives 
nothing from like. And I thought that he who said this was a charming man, and 
that he spoke well. What do the rest of you say?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
should say, at first hearing, that he is right, said Menexenus.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
we are to say that the greatest friendship is of opposites?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Exactly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
Menexenus; but will not that be a monstrous answer? and will not the all-wise 
eristics be down upon us in triumph, and ask, fairly enough, whether love is not 
the very opposite of hate; and what answer shall we make to them-must we not 
admit that they speak the truth?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We 
must.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
will then proceed to ask whether the enemy is the friend of the friend, or the 
friend the friend of the enemy?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Neither, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, 
but is a just man the friend of the unjust, or the temperate of the intemperate, 
or the good of the bad?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I do 
not see how that is possible.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
yet, I said, if friendship goes by contraries, the contraries must be friends.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
must.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
neither like and like nor unlike and unlike are friends.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
suppose not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
yet there is a further consideration: may not all these notions of friendship be 
erroneous? but may not that which is neither good nor evil still in some cases 
be the friend of the good?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How do 
you mean? he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why 
really, I said, the truth is that I do not know; but my head is dizzy with 
thinking of the argument, and therefore I hazard the conjecture, that &quot;the 
beautiful is the friend,&quot; as the old proverb says. Beauty is certainly a soft, 
smooth, slippery thing, and therefore of a nature which easily slips in and 
permeates our souls. For I affirm that the good is the beautiful. You will agree 
to that?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This I 
say from a sort of notion that what is neither good nor evil is the friend of 
the beautiful and the good, and I will tell you why I am inclined to think so: I 
assume that there are three principles-the good, the bad, and that which is 
neither good nor bad. You would agree-would you not?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
agree.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
neither is the good the friend of the good, nor the evil of the good, nor the 
good of the evil;-these alternatives are excluded by the previous argument; and 
therefore, if there be such a thing as friendship or love at all, we must infer 
that what is neither good nor evil must be the friend, either of the good, or of 
that which is neither good nor evil, for nothing can be the friend of the bad.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
neither can like be the friend of like, as we were just now saying.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And if 
so, that which is neither good nor evil can have no friend which is neither good 
nor evil.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Clearly not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
the good alone is the friend of that only which is neither good nor evil.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
may be assumed to be certain.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
does not this seem to put us in the right way? Just remark, that the body which 
is in health requires neither medical nor any other aid, but is well enough; and 
the healthy man has no love of the physician, because he is in health.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He has 
none.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
the sick loves him, because he is sick?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
sickness is an evil, and the art of medicine a good and useful thing?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
the human body, regarded as a body, is neither good nor evil?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
the body is compelled by reason of disease to court and make friends of the art 
of medicine?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
that which is neither good nor evil becomes the friend of good, by reason of the 
presence of evil?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So we 
may infer.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
clearly this must have happened before that which was neither good nor evil had 
become altogether corrupted with the element of evil-if itself had become evil 
it would not still desire and love the good; for, as we were saying, the evil 
cannot be the friend of the good.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Impossible.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Further, I must observe that some substances are assimilated when others are 
present with them; and there are some which are not assimilated: take, for 
example, the case of an ointment or colour which is put on another substance.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
good.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 
such a case, is the substance which is anointed the same as the colour or 
ointment?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What 
do you mean? he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This 
is what I mean: Suppose that I were to cover your auburn locks with white lead, 
would they be really white, or would they only appear to be white?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
would only appear to be white, he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
yet whiteness would be present in them?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
that would not make them at all the more white, notwithstanding the presence of 
white in them-they would not be white any more than black?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
when old age infuses whiteness into them, then they become assimilated, and are 
white by the presence of white.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now I 
want to know whether in all cases a substance is assimilated by the presence of 
another substance; or must the presence be after a peculiar sort?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 
latter, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
that which is neither good nor evil may be in the presence of evil, but not as 
yet evil, and that has happened before now?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
when anything is in the presence of evil, not being as yet evil, the presence of 
good arouses the desire of good in that thing; but the presence of evil, which 
makes a thing evil, takes away the desire and friendship of the good; for that 
which was once both good and evil has now become evil only, and the good was 
supposed to have no friendship with the evil?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;None.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
therefore we say that those who are already wise, whether Gods or men, are no 
longer lovers of wisdom; nor can they be lovers of wisdom who are ignorant to 
the extent of being evil, for no evil or ignorant person is a lover of wisdom. 
There remain those who have the misfortune to be ignorant, but are not yet 
hardened in their ignorance, or void of understanding, and do not as yet fancy 
that they know what they do not know: and therefore those who are the lovers of 
wisdom are as yet neither good nor bad. But the bad do not love wisdom any more 
than the good; for, as we have already seen, neither is unlike the friend of 
unlike, nor like of like. You remember that?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
they both said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
so, Lysis and Menexenus, we have discovered the nature of friendship-there can 
be no doubt of it: Friendship is the love which by reason of the presence of 
evil the neither good nor evil has of the good, either in the soul, or in the 
body, or anywhere.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
both agreed and entirely assented, and for a moment I rejoiced and was satisfied 
like a huntsman just holding fast his prey. But then a most unaccountable 
suspicion came across me, and I felt that the conclusion was untrue. I was 
pained, and said, Alas! Lysis and Menexenus, I am afraid that we have been 
grasping at a shadow only.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why do 
you say so? said Menexenus.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am 
afraid, I said, that the argument about friendship is false: arguments, like 
men, are often pretenders.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How do 
you mean? he asked.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, 
I said; look at the matter in this way: a friend is the friend of some one; is 
he not?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly he is.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
has he a motive and object in being a friend, or has he no motive and object?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He has 
a motive and object.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And is 
the object which makes him a friend, dear to him, neither dear nor hateful to 
him?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I do 
not quite follow you, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I do 
not wonder at that, I said. But perhaps, if I put the matter in another way, you 
will be able to follow me, and my own meaning will be clearer to myself. The 
sick man, as I was just now saying, is the friend of the physician-is he not?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And he 
is the friend of the physician because of disease, and for the sake of health?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
disease is an evil?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
what of health? I said. Is that good or evil, or neither?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Good, 
he replied.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And we 
were saying, I believe, that the body being neither good nor evil, because of 
disease, that is to say because of evil, is the friend of medicine, and medicine 
is a good: and medicine has entered into this friendship for the sake of health, 
and health is a good.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And is 
health a friend, or not a friend?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A 
friend.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
disease is an enemy?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
that which is neither good nor evil is the friend of the good because of the 
evil and hateful, and for the sake of the good and the friend?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Clearly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
the friend is a friend for the sake of the friend, and because of the enemy?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
is to be inferred.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
at this point, my boys, let us take heed, and be on our guard against 
deceptions. I will not again repeat that the friend is the friend of the friend, 
and the like of the like, which has been declared by us to be an impossibility; 
but, in order that this new statement may not delude us, let us attentively 
examine another point, which I will proceed to explain: Medicine, as we were 
saying, is a friend, dear to us for the sake of health?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
health is also dear?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And if 
dear, then dear for the sake of something?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
surely this object must also be dear, as is implied in our previous admissions?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
that something dear involves something else dear?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
then, proceeding in this way, shall we not arrive at some first principle of 
friendship or dearness which is not capable of being referred to any other, for 
the sake of which, as we maintain, all other things are dear, and, having there 
arrived, we shall stop?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My 
fear is that all those other things, which, as we say, are dear for the sake of 
another, are illusions and deceptions only, but where that first principle is, 
there is the true ideal of friendship. Let me put the matter thus: Suppose the 
case of a great treasure (this may be a son, who is more precious to his father 
than all his other treasures); would not the father, who values his son above 
all things, value other things also for the sake of his son? I mean, for 
instance, if he knew that his son had drunk hemlock, and the father thought that 
wine would save him, he would value the wine?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
would.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
also the vessel which contains the wine?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
does he therefore value the three measures of wine, or the earthen vessel which 
contains them, equally with his son? Is not this rather the true state of the 
case? All his anxiety has regard not to the means which are provided for the 
sake of an object, but to the object for the sake of which they are provided. 
And although we may often say that gold and silver are highly valued by us, that 
is not the truth; for there is a further object, whatever it may be, which we 
value most of all, and for the sake of which gold and all out other possessions 
are acquired by us. Am I not right?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
may not the same be said of the friend? That which is only dear to us for the 
sake of something else is improperly said to be dear, but the truly dear is that 
in which all these so called dear friendships terminate.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That, 
he said, appears to be true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
the truly dear or ultimate principle of friendship is not for the sake of any 
other or further dear.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
we have done with the notion that friendship has any further object. May we then 
infer that the good is the friend?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
think so.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
the good is loved for the sake of the evil? Let me put the case in this way: 
Suppose that of the three principles, good, evil, and that which is neither good 
nor evil, there remained only the good and the neutral, and that evil went far 
away, and in no way affected soul or body, nor ever at all that class of things 
which, as we say, are neither good nor evil in themselves;-would the good be of 
any use, or other than useless to us? For if there were nothing to hurt us any 
longer, we should have no need of anything that would do us good. Then would be 
clearly seen that we did but love and desire the good because of the evil, and 
as the remedy of the evil, which was the disease; but if there had been no 
disease, there would have been no need of a remedy. Is not this the nature of 
the good-to be loved by us who are placed between the two, because of the evil? 
but there is no use in the good for its own sake.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
suppose not.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
the final principle of friendship, in which all other friendships terminated, 
those, I mean, which are relatively dear and for the sake of something else, is 
of another and a different nature from them. For they are called dear because of 
another dear or friend. But with the true friend or dear, the case is quite the 
reverse; for that is proved to be dear because of the hated, and if the hated 
were away it would be no longer dear.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
true, he replied: at any rate not if our present view holds good.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But, 
oh! will you tell me, I said, whether if evil were to perish, we should hunger 
any more, or thirst any more, or have any similar desire? Or may we suppose that 
hunger will remain while men and animals remain, but not so as to be hurtful? 
And the same of thirst and the other desires,-that they will remain, but will 
not be evil because evil has perished? Or rather shall I say, that to ask what 
either will be then or will not be is ridiculous, for who knows? This we do 
know, that in our present condition hunger may injure us, and may also benefit 
us:-Is not that true?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And in 
like manner thirst or any similar desire may sometimes be a good and sometimes 
an evil to us, and sometimes neither one nor the other?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be 
sure.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But is 
there any reason why, because evil perishes, that which is not evil should 
perish with it?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;None.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, 
even if evil perishes, the desires which are neither good nor evil will remain?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Clearly they will.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
must not a man love that which he desires and affects?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He 
must.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, 
even if evil perishes, there may still remain some elements of love or 
friendship?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
not if evil is the cause of friendship: for in that case nothing will be the 
friend of any other thing after the destruction of evil; for the effect cannot 
remain when the cause is destroyed.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
have we not admitted already that the friend loves something for a reason? and 
at the time of making the admission we were of opinion that the neither good nor 
evil loves the good because of the evil?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
now our view is changed, and we conceive that there must be some other cause of 
friendship?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
suppose so.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;May 
not the truth be rather, as we were saying just now, that desire is the cause of 
friendship; for that which desires is dear to that which is desired at the time 
of desiring it? and may not the other theory have been only a long story about 
nothing?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Likely 
enough.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
surely, I said, he who desires, desires that of which he is in want?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
that of which he is in want is dear to him?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And he 
is in want of that of which he is deprived?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
love, and desire, and friendship would appear to be of the natural or congenial. 
Such, Lysis and Menexenus, is the inference.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
assented.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
if you are friends, you must have natures which are congenial to one another?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Certainly, they both said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I 
say, my boys, that no one who loves or desires another would ever have loved or 
desired or affected him, if he had not been in some way congenial to him, either 
in his soul, or in his character, or in his manners, or in his form.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, 
yes, said Menexenus. But Lysis was silent.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, 
I said, the conclusion is, that what is of a congenial nature must be loved.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It 
follows, he said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
the lover, who is true and no counterfeit, must of necessity be loved by his 
love.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lysis 
and Menexenus gave a faint assent to this; and Hippothales changed into all 
manner of colours with delight.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Here, 
intending to revise the argument, I said: Can we point out any difference 
between the congenial and the like? For if that is possible, then I think, Lysis 
and Menexenus, there may be some sense in our argument about friendship. But if 
the congenial is only the like, how will you get rid of the other argument, of 
the uselessness of like to like in as far as they are like; for to say that what 
is useless is dear, would be absurd? Suppose, then, that we agree to distinguish 
between the congenial and the like-in the intoxication of argument, that may 
perhaps be allowed.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very 
true.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And 
shall we further say that the good is congenial, and the evil uncongenial to 
every one? Or again that the evil is congenial to the evil, and the good to the 
good; and that which is neither good nor evil to that which is neither good nor 
evil?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They 
agreed to the latter alternative.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, 
my boys, we have again fallen into the old discarded error; for the unjust will 
be the friend of the unjust, and the bad of the bad, as well as the good of the 
good.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That 
appears to be the result.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
again, if we say that the congenial is the same as the good, in that case the 
good and he only will be the friend of the good.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;True.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But 
that too was a position of ours which, as you will remember, has been already 
refuted by ourselves.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We 
remember.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then 
what is to be done? Or rather is there anything to be done? I can only, like the 
wise men who argue in courts, sum up the arguments:-If neither the beloved, nor 
the lover, nor the like, nor the unlike, nor the good, nor the congenial, nor 
any other of whom we spoke-for there were such a number of them that I cannot 
remember all-if none of these are friends, I know not what remains to be said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Here I 
was going to invite the opinion of some older person, when suddenly we were 
interrupted by the tutors of Lysis and Menexenus, who came upon us like an evil 
apparition with their brothers, and bade them go home, as it was getting late. 
At first, we and the bystanders drove them off; but afterwards, as they would 
not mind, and only went on shouting in their barbarous dialect, and got angry, 
and kept calling the boys-they appeared to us to have been drinking rather too 
much at the Hermaea, which made them difficult to manage we fairly gave way and 
broke up the company.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
said, however, a few words to the boys at parting: O Menexenus and Lysis, how 
ridiculous that you two boys, and I, an old boy, who would fain be one of you, 
should imagine ourselves to be friends-this is what the by-standers will go away 
and say-and as yet we have not been able to discover what is a friend!</span></font></p>
