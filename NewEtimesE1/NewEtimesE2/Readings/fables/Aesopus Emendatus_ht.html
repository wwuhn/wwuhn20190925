to change her into a woman.
"I should think," said Venus, "you might make so trifling a change

Afterward, wishing to see if the change were complete, Venus caused

"My boys, there is a great treasure buried in the vineyard.  You
dig in the ground until you find it."

"No," said the Dog; "if I were to accept that, it might be thought
that in biting you I was actuated by improper motives."
"And by what motives were you actuated?" asked the Man.
"I desired," replied the Dog, "merely to harmonise myself with the Divine Scheme of Things.  I'm a child of Nature."</font><p>

"Who art thou?" asked the Man, "and why dost thou dwell in this
dreadful place?"
"My name," replied the Woman, "is Truth; and I live in the desert

"The priest will catch you and sacrifice you," said the Wolf, "if you remain there."
"It is just as well to be sacrificed by the priest as to be eaten&nbsp; by you," said the Lamb.
"My friend," said the Wolf, "it pains me to see you considering so

vultures hovering significantly above them. "Let us make up our
quarrel," said the Boar," or these fellows will get one of us,&nbsp;
sure."
"I should not so much mind that," replied the Lion, "if they would
get the right one.  However, I am willing to stop fighting, and then perhaps I can grab a vulture.  I like chicken better than

Ass asked.

"Lions have a superstitious terror of my voice, "answered the Cock,

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A CERTAIN City desiring to purchase a site for a public Deformatory 
procured an appropriation from the Government of the country.  
Deeming this insufficient for purchase of the site and payment of 
reasonable commissions to themselves, the men in charge of the 
matter asked for a larger sum, which was readily given.  Believing 
that the fountain could not be dipped dry, they applied for still

intelligence and elevating the moral sentiment of the public.  They 
had been doing this for some time, when an Eminent Statesman stuck 
his head out of the pool of politics, and, speaking for the members 
of his profession, said:

"My friends, I beg you will desist.  I know you make a great deal 
of money by this kind of thing, but consider the damage you inflict 
upon the business of others!" </font>
