  <p align="justify">After he gave his word to Yai Phloy, Lung Maa couldn't think of what to 
  tell his
  daughter. His heart ached, knowing that the words Yai Phloy had uttered that 
  day
  were outright lies. But what was he to have done? No matter what, he would 
  have
  to let his daughter go with Yai Phloy. So what point would there have been in
  disagreeing with her, in forcing her to speak the truth? Wouldn't he only be
  degrading himself by admitting openly for everyone to hear that he was so
  destitute that he had to sell his daughter. Far better to let Yai Phloy go on
  with her eloquent deception. However wrong, he could then mumble that he had
  been tricked by Yai Phloy. In any event, a man is better branded as having 
  been
  conned that branded as having sold his daughter into prostitution.<br>
  <br>
  Yai Phloy's soliloquy was most pervasive. Anyone listening to it would have 
  been
  seduced by it. Yai Phloy began by elucidating in great detail about how
  children's behavior these days was getting steadily worse and worse, 
  especially
  city children, and especially in Bangkok. This was because their parents were 
  so
  busy working, striving to get ahead, that they had not time to stay at home 
  with
  their children. Instead, the children were ignored until they finally got into
  trouble. Hiring someone to take care of the children was extremely difficult.
  Some hired servants who, as soon as their employers weren't watching, 
  absconded
  with everything in the house. Lost of them stole, even if just a little here 
  and
  there. But the major problem was that servants were so unreliable. As soon as
  they were the least bit tired or were criticized or scolded in the least. They
  ran away back to their homes. Consequently, several of Bangkok's wealthy elite
  had requested Yai Phloy to find them dependable girls to be their servants. 
  They
  paid good wages and, moreover, even paid money in advance. As many girls as 
  she
  could get would be placed.<br>
  <br>
  Even though Yai Phloy was not from his village, Lung Maa had known Yai Phloy
  since she had been a young girl. In those days, her beauty was known 
  throughout
  the subdistrict. But before any of the local youths were able to compete for
  possession, Yai Phloy had already run off to Bangkok with someone who had 
  passed
  through with the medicine show. Much, much later, when she finally came back,
  word had it that she had become thoroughly Bangkokian, with a haughty manner 
  and
  pretentious lifestyles. She appeared to have become a lady of no insignificant
  wealth. Yai Phloy went back and forth to Bangkok often. Of the girls that went
  to Bangkok with her, some came back even poorer than before. And some
  disappeared completely. <br>
  <br>
  Lung Maa knew perfectly well what kind of work the girls who went with Yai 
  Phloy
  did in Bangkok, because one day he had gone to get an injection at the 
  district
  health center. That day, the only too discreet doctor there had told him that
  two or three girls who had gone to Bangkok with Yai Phloy had come back with
  severe cases of gonorrhea, so severe that he had to send them into town for
  treatment.<br>
  <br>
  Lung Maa heaved a deep sigh as he thought of his daughter who was soon to 
  become
  one more in the ranks of unlucky girls. He wanted to talk with his daughter so
  she would understand and be as untroubled as possible. But he could think of
  nothing to say.<br>
  <br>
  Paa Saeng, his partner through life, was lying sick in the hospital in the 
  city,
  suffering from an intestinal problem. She was waiting for the money that would
  be used to pay for the blood and surgery needed to sustain her life. Her
  survival, though, would only continue her pain and suffering.<br>
  <br>
  He couldn't borrow money from anyone else any more. His present debt totalled
  already about 10,000 baht. He'd been in debt for nearly ten years. In all 
  those
  years, all his efforts had only succeeded in ensuring that his debts 
  compounded
  interest slowly.<br>
  <br>
  One year, the garlic price had been exceptionally good, which was why he found
  himself in his present state. The merchants that year had come directly to the
  village, buying at fourteen to fifteen baht a kilo. It meant that, for once,
  Lung Maa had enough money to think of working for a better life. So, he 
  borrowed<br>
  10,000 baht. With that and the money he had saved previously, he bought 
  another
  three rai of paddyfield. He was willing to pay the interest rate of 150 thang
  (Note: Thang [pronounced taang+ not thaang+] is a northern Thai version of
  bushel. During 1977, one thang of rice can be sold for 45-50 baht. Please note
  also that one rai [=1,600 sq. meters or 0.4 acre] of land yields 30-60 thang 
  per
  crop.) of rice per year. He had planned to use the entire rice crop from the
  newly bought land to pay the interest and use the money from the dry season to
  pay off the original loan.<br>
  <br>
  But he met with bad luck. The following year, the garlic prices dropped to
  between thirty and fifty satang (one 100th of baht) a kilo, despite his effort
  to appease the merchants by bringing the garlic directly to their warehouses 
  and
  despite the fact that the seed he had bought had been very expensive, nearly
  fifty baht per kilo. He thought they were probably garlic seeds imported from
  China. That year began his downward cycle. No matter how he struggled by 
  trying
  other crops, the profit he made was only enough to see his family through. One
  year, the price of rice dropped to five baht a thang, forcing him to give up 
  his
  new plot of land to his creditor. But he was still left with debts worth more
  than the plot of land he had inherited from his parents. He debts kept 
  steadily
  increasing. Now he was working his remaining four rai without getting anything
  himself, because the rice yield went to pay the interest on his debts. The 
  hope
  that he would one day clear himself of his debts had faded.
  <br><br>
  As he thought of his past, his eyes brimmed with tears of bitterness at his
  fate, welling over as his thoughts turned to the future. In another tow or 
  three
  days, his daughter, while still living, would be forced into hell in Bangkok. 
  In
  two or three weeks, he would once again face the painful sight of his creditor
  callously coming to collect 200 thang of rice. This year there had not been
  enough water, so he was not sure if he would have enough rice to pay, and if
  there would be any left over. Agony tore his heart as he recalled the words of
  his creditor, echoing in his mind: &quot;Maa, the money you've borrowed from me now
  amounts to more than the value of the land you mortgaged. What am I to do? If 
  it
  keeps on like this, I'm afraid I's going to have to ask to claim your land and
  house. Next year my son is going abroad, so I'll be having a lot of expenses
  myself. So please try to pay me by then, if even only the interest.&quot;
  <br>
  * * *<br>
  <br>
  So now his daughter had gone with Yai Phloy. He had controlled his tears. His
  parting words to his daughter had been to obey Yai Phloy without questions. If
  she had any problems, she should write a letter and let him know. He consoled
  her by saying if he had a chance, he would come to visit her. Of what he had
  prepared to tell her, nor a single word would come out.<br>
  <br>
  The 2,500 baht he had received as an advance from Yai Phloy was barely enough 
  to
  pay for Paa Saeng's hospital expenses. And when Paa Saeng returned home and
  learned that her daughter had gone off with Yai Phloy, she fainted instantly.<br>
  <br>
  When she recovered, she began sobbing and sobbing. She wouldn't talk to or 
  even
  look Lung Maa in face, let alone any of her other five children who were
  standing around her. Lung Maa could think of nothing to say, so he sought 
  silent
  refuge in making bamboo ties. (Note: About 2 feet long ties made of bamboo are
  to be used in binding the harvested rice stalks together) <br>
  <br>
  Late that night, when all their children were asleep, Paa Saeng's voice, 
  muffled
  with the sounds of weeping, whispered, &quot;Phii Maa, didn't you know what Ee 
  Phloy
  took our daughter to do?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Mother, I knew, but it was necessary. You know as well as I that we had no
  choice. When you were in hospital, if we didn't have the money to pay for the
  cost of medicine, the blood, the saline, and other expenses, the doctor 
  wouldn't
  have been willing to treat you. They wouldn't let us go to the destitute ward.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Are you angry with me?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;No, I'm not angry. But I feel so sad. Ever since I was born, there's been
  nothing but suffering.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Do you know Yai Phloy well?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Oh, the people in the market place know her only too well. She's taken 
  several
  of their daughters to sell already. She gets paid 500 baht a head for some,
  2-300 baht for others. She takes whatever she can get. She's been a prostitute
  herself, ever since she was young. When she was not longer able to sell 
  herself,
  she began selling young girls instead. Her parents had a lot of debts then. 
  Now
  things seem to be going better for them, but they still owe money.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;I worry about our daughter. I feel so sorry for her. Ever since she left, I
  don't sleep at night.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Phii Maa, the matter has happened and nothing can be done, so we might as 
  well
  let it pass. We'll help each other to share the burden of our demerit. It's 
  just
  as if she has gone off and gotten a husband, only that she doesn't have a real
  husband...By the time she can earn the money to help her parents, I wonder how
  many husbands she will have to have...&quot;<br>
