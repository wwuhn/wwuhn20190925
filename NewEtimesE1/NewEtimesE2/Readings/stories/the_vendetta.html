<HR SIZE="1">

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Paolo Saverini's widow lived alone with her son in a poor little
house on the ramparts of Bonifacio. The town, built on a spur of
the mountains, in places actually overhanging the sea, looks across
a channel bristling with reefs, to the lower shores of Sardinia. At
its foot, on the other side and almost completely surrounding it,
is the channel that serves as its harbour, cut in the cliff like a
gigantic corridor. Through a long circuit between steep walls, the
channel brings to the very foot of the first houses the little
Italian or Sardinian fishing-boats, and, every fortnight, the old
steamboat that runs to and from Ajaccio.</font></p>
<p></p>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Upon the white mountain the group of houses form a whiter patch
still. They look like the nests of wild birds, perched so upon the
rock, dominating that terrible channel through which hardly ever a
ship risks a passage. The unresting wind harasses the sea and eats
away the bare shore, clad with a sparse covering of grass; it
rushes into the ravine and ravages its two sides. The trailing
wisps of white foam round the black points of countless rocks that
everywhere pierce the waves, look like rags of canvas floating and
heaving on the surface of the water.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The widow Saverini's house held for dear life to the very edge of
the cliff; its three windows looked out over this wild and desolate
scene.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">She lived there alone with her son Antoine and their bitch
Semillante, a large, thin animal with long, shaggy hair, of the
sheep-dog breed. The young man used her for hunting.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">One evening, after a quarrel, Antoine Saverini was treacherously
slain by a knife-thrust from Nicolas Ravolati, who got away to
Sardinia the same night.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">When his old mother received his body, carried home by bystanders,
she did not weep, but for a long time stayed motionless, looking at
it; then, stretching out her wrinkled hand over the body, she swore
vendetta against him. She would have no one stay with her, and shut
herself up with the body, together with the howling dog. The animal
howled continuously, standing at the foot of the bed, her head
thrust towards her master, her tail held tightly between her legs.
She did not stir, nor did the mother, who crouched over the body
with her eyes fixed steadily upon it, and wept great silent tears.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The young man, lying on his back, clad in his thick serge coat with
a hole torn across the front, looked as though he slept; but
everywhere there was blood; on the shirt, torn off for the first
hasty dressing; on his waistcoat, on his breeches, on his face, on
his hands. Clots of blood had congealed in his beard and in his
hair.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The old mother began to speak to him. At the sound of her voice the
dog was silent.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">"There, there, you shall be avenged, my little one, my boy, my poor
child. Sleep, sleep, you shall be avenged, do you hear! Your mother
swears it! And your mother always keeps her word; you know she
does."</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Slowly she bent over him, pressing her cold lips on the dead lips.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Then Semillante began to howl once more. She uttered long cries,
monotonous, heart-rending, horrible cries.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">They remained there, the pair of them, the woman and the dog, till
morning.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Antoine Saverini was buried next day, and before long there was no
more talk of him in Bonifacio.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">He had left neither brothers nor close cousins. No man was there to
carry on the vendetta. Only his mother, an old woman, brooded over
it.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">On the other side of the channel she watched from morning till
night a white speck on the coast. It was a little Sardinian
village, Longosardo, where Corsican bandits fled for refuge when
too hard pressed. They formed almost the entire population of this
hamlet, facing the shores of their own country, and there they
awaited a suitable moment to come home, to return to the maquis of
Corsica. She knew that Nicolas Ravolati had taken refuge in this
very village.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">All alone, all day long, sitting by the window, she looked over
there and pondered revenge. How could she do it without another's
help, so feeble as she was, so near to death? But she had promised,
she had sworn upon the body. She could not forget, she could not
wait. What was she to do? She could no longer sleep at night, she
had no more sleep nor peace; obstinately she searched for a way.
The dog slumbered at her feet and sometimes, raising her head,
howled into the empty spaces. Since her master had gone, she often
howled thus, as though she were calling him, as though her animal
soul, inconsolable, had retained an ineffaceable memory of him.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">One night, as Semillante was beginning to moan again, the mother
had a sudden idea, an idea quite natural to a vindictive and
ferocious savage. She meditated on it till morning, then, rising at
the approach of day, she went to church. She prayed, kneeling on
the stones, prostrate before God, begging Him to aid her, to
sustain her, to grant her poor worn-out body the strength necessary
to avenge her son.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Then she returned home. There stood in the yard an old barrel with
its sides stove in, which held the rain-water; she overturned it,
emptied it, and fixed it to the ground with stakes and stones; then
she chained up Semillante in this kennel, and went into the house.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Next she began to walk up and down her room, taking no rest, her
eyes still turned to the coast of Sardinia. He was there, the
murderer.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">All day long and all night long the dog howled. In the morning the
old woman took her some water in a bowl, but nothing else; no soup,
no bread.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Another day went by. Semillante, exhausted, was asleep. Next day
her eyes were shining, her hair on end, and she tugged desperately
at the chain.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Again the old woman gave her nothing to eat. The animal, mad with
hunger, barked hoarsely. Another night went by.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">When day broke, Mother Saverini went to her neighbour to ask him to
give her two trusses of straw. She took the old clothes her husband
had worn and stuffed them with the straw into the likeness of a
human figure.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Having planted a post in the ground opposite Semillante's kennel,
she tied the dummy figure to it, which looked now as though it were
standing. Then she fashioned a head with a roll of old linen.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The dog, surprised, looked at this straw man, and was silent,
although devoured with hunger.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Then the woman went to the pork-butcher and bought a long piece of
black pudding. She returned home, lit a wood fire in her yard,
close to the kennel, and grilled the black pudding. Semillante,
maddened, leapt about and foamed at the mouth, her eyes fixed on
the food, the flavour of which penetrated to her very stomach.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Then with the smoking sausage the mother made a collar for the
straw man. She spent a long time lashing it round his neck, as
though to stuff it right in. When it was done, she unchained the
dog.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">With a tremendous bound the animal leapt upon the dummy's throat
and with her paws on his shoulders began to rend it. She fell back
with a piece of the prey in her mouth, then dashed at it again,
sank her teeth into the cords, tore away a few fragments of food,
fell back again, and leapt once more, ravenous. </font> </P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">With great bites she rent away the face, and tore the whole neck to
shreds.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The old woman watched, motionless and silent, a gleam in her eyes.
Then she chained up her dog again, made her go without food for two
more days, and repeated the strange performance.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">For three months she trained the dog to this struggle, the conquest
of a meal by fangs. She no longer chained her up, but launched her
upon the dummy with a sign.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">She had taught the dog to rend and devour it without hiding food in
its throat. Afterwards she would reward the dog with the gift of
the black pudding she had cooked for her.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as she saw the man, Semillante would tremble, then turn her
eyes towards her mistress, who would cry "Off!" in a whistling
tone, raising her finger.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">When she judged that the time was come, Mother Saverini went to
confession and took communion one Sunday morning with an ecstatic
fervour; then, putting on a man's clothes, like an old ragged
beggar, she bargained with a Sardinian fisherman, who took her,
accompanied by the dog, to the other side of the straits.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">In a canvas bag she had a large piece of black pudding. Semillante
had had nothing to eat for two days. Every minute the old woman
made her smell the savoury food, stimulating her hunger with it.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">They came to Longosardo. The Corsican woman was limping slightly.
She went to the baker's and inquired for Nicolas Ravolati's house.
He had resumed his old occupation, that of a joiner. He was working
alone at the back of his shop.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The old woman pushed open the door and called him:</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">"Hey! Nicolas!"</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">He turned round; then, letting go of her dog, she cried:</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">"Off, off, bite him, bite him!"</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The maddened beast dashed forward and seized his throat.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">The man put out his arms, clasped the dog, and rolled upon the
ground. For a few minutes he writhed, beating the ground with his
feet; then he remained motionless while Semillante nuzzled at his
throat and tore it out in ribbons.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">Two neighbours, sitting at their doors, plainly recollected having
seen a poor old man come out with a lean black dog which ate, as it
walked, something brown that its master was giving to it.</font></P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman">In the evening the old woman returned home. That night she slept
well.</font></P>
