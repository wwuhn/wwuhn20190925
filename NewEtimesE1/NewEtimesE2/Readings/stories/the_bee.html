<p><font face="Times New Roman">It was Maeterlinck who introduced me to the bee.  I mean, in
the psychical and in the poetical way.  I had had a business
introduction earlier.  It was when I was a boy.  It is strange
that I should remember a formality like that so long; it must be
nearly sixty years.</font></p>
<P>
<font face="Times New Roman">Bee scientists always speak of the bee as she.  It is
because all the important bees are of that sex.  In the hive
there is one married bee, called the queen; she has fifty
thousand children; of these, about one hundred are sons; the rest
are daughters.  Some of the daughters are young maids, some are
old maids, and all are virgins and remain so.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">Every spring the queen comes out of the hive and flies away
with one of her sons and marries him.  The honeymoon lasts only
an hour or two; then the queen divorces her husband and returns
home competent to lay two million eggs.  This will be enough to
last the year, but not more than enough, because hundreds of bees
are drowned every day, and other hundreds are eaten by birds, and
it is the queen's business to keep the population up to standard
--say, fifty thousand.  She must always have that many children
on hand and efficient during the busy season, which is summer, or
winter would catch the community short of food.  She lays from
two thousand to three thousand eggs a day, according to the
demand; and she must exercise judgment, and not lay more than are
needed in a slim flower-harvest, nor fewer than are required in a
prodigal one, or the board of directors will dethrone her and
elect a queen that has more sense.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">There are always a few royal heirs in stock and ready to
take her place--ready and more than anxious to do it, although
she is their own mother.  These girls are kept by themselves, and
are regally fed and tended from birth.  No other bees get such
fine food as they get, or live such a high and luxurious life.
By consequence they are larger and longer and sleeker than their
working sisters.  And they have a curved sting, shaped like a
scimitar, while the others have a straight one.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">A common bee will sting any one or anybody, but a royalty
stings royalties only.  A common bee will sting and kill another
common bee, for cause, but when it is necessary to kill the queen
other ways are employed.  When a queen has grown old and slack
and does not lay eggs enough one of her royal daughters is
allowed to come to attack her, the rest of the bees looking on at
the duel and seeing fair play.  It is a duel with the curved
stings.  If one of the fighters gets hard pressed and gives it up
and runs, she is brought back and must try again--once, maybe
twice; then, if she runs yet once more for her life, judicial
death is her portion; her children pack themselves into a ball
around her person and hold her in that compact grip two or three
days, until she starves to death or is suffocated.  Meantime the
victor bee is receiving royal honors and performing the one royal
function--laying eggs.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">As regards the ethics of the judicial assassination of the
queen, that is a matter of politics, and will be discussed later,
in its proper place.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">During substantially the whole of her short life of five or
six years the queen lives in Egyptian darkness and stately
seclusion of the royal apartments, with none about her but
plebeian servants, who give her empty lip-affection in place of
the love which her heart hungers for; who spy upon her in the
interest of her waiting heirs, and report and exaggerate her
defects and deficiencies to them; who fawn upon her and flatter
her to her face and slander her behind her back; who grovel
before her in the day of her power and forsake her in her age and
weakness.  There she sits, friendless, upon her throne through
the long night of her life, cut off from the consoling sympathies
and sweet companionship and loving endearments which she craves,
by the gilded barriers of her awful rank; a forlorn exile in her
own house and home, weary object of formal ceremonies and
machine-made worship, winged child of the sun, native to the free
air and the blue skies and the flowery fields, doomed by the
splendid accident of her birth to trade this priceless heritage
for a black captivity, a tinsel grandeur, and a loveless life,
with shame and insult at the end and a cruel death--and condemned
by the human instinct in her to hold the bargain valuable!</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">Huber, Lubbock, Maeterlinck--in fact, all the great
authorities--are agreed in denying that the bee is a member of
the human family.  I do not know why they have done this, but I
think it is from dishonest motives.  Why, the innumerable facts
brought to light by their own painstaking and exhaustive
experiments prove that if there is a master fool in the world, it
is the bee.  That seems to settle it.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">But that is the way of the scientist.  He will spend thirty
years in building up a mountain range of facts with the intent to
prove a certain theory; then he is so happy in his achievement
that as a rule he overlooks the main chief fact of all--that his
accumulation proves an entirely different thing.  When you point
out this miscarriage to him he does not answer your letters; when
you call to convince him, the servant prevaricates and you do not
get in.  Scientists have odious manners, except when you prop up
their theory; then you can borrow money of them.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">To be strictly fair, I will concede that now and then one of
them will answer your letter, but when they do they avoid the
issue--you cannot pin them down.  When I discovered that the bee
was human I wrote about it to all those scientists whom I have
just mentioned.  For evasions, I have seen nothing to equal the
answers I got.</font><P>
<font face="Times New Roman">After the queen, the personage next in importance in the
hive is the virgin.  The virgins are fifty thousand or one
hundred thousand in number, and they are the workers, the
laborers.  No work is done, in the hive or out of it, save by
them.  The males do not work, the queen does no work, unless
laying eggs is work, but it does not seem so to me.  There are
only two million of them, anyway, and all of five months to
finish the contract in.  The distribution of work in a hive is as
cleverly and elaborately specialized as it is in a vast American
machine-shop or factory.  A bee that has been trained to one of
the many and various industries of the concern doesn't know how
to exercise any other, and would be offended if asked to take a
hand in anything outside of her profession.  She is as human as a
cook; and if you should ask the cook to wait on the table, you
know what will happen.  Cooks will play the piano if you like,
but they draw the line there.  In my time I have asked a cook to
chop wood, and I know about these things.  Even the hired girl
has her frontiers; true, they are vague, they are ill-defined,
even flexible, but they are there.  This is not conjecture; it is
founded on the absolute.  And then the butler.  You ask the
butler to wash the dog.  It is just as I say; there is much to be
learned in these ways, without going to books.  Books are very well,
but books do not cover the whole domain of esthetic human culture.
Pride of profession is one of the boniest bones in existence,
if not the boniest.  Without doubt it is so in the hive.</font><P><HR SIZE=1>
