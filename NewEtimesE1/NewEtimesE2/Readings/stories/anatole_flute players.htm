  <P><font face="Times New Roman">In aesthetics, that is to say in the clouds, one can argue more and better 
  than in any other subject. It is there that one must be cautious. It is there 
  that one has everything to fear: indifference as well as partiality, coldness 
  as well as passion, knowledge as well as ignorance, artfulness, wit, subtlety 
  and an innocence which is more dangerous than craft. In al] matters of 
  aesthetics you must dread sophisms, especially when they are beautiful, and 
  you will find admirable ones. In this field you must not even trust the 
  mathematical mind, which is so perfect and so sublime, but of such delicacy as 
  a mechanism that it cannot work except in the void, because a grain of sand in 
  its wheelwork is enough to make it go wrong. One shudders when one thinks to 
  what length such a grain of sand can drag a mathematical brain. Think of 
  Pascal!</font></P>
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">Aesthetics is founded on nothing solid. It is a castle in the air. Men have 
  tried to prop it upon ethics. But there is no ethics. There is no sociology. 
  Nor is there any biology. The completion of the sciences has never existed 
  except in the brain of M. Auguste Comte, whose books are prophetical. When an 
  exact biology will have been established, that is to say in some millions of 
  years, it may perhaps be possible to establish a sociology. That will also 
  take a great number of centuries. Then will come the time when you may 
  properly create an aesthetic science on solid foundations. But by that time 
  our planet will be very old and will approach the term of its destiny. The sun 
  whose spots, not without reason, trouble us even now, will in those days turn 
  to the earth a face of somber and fuliginous red, half covered by opaque 
  scoriae, and the last men, taking refuge in the depths of mines, will be less 
  anxious to dispute on the essence of the beautiful than to bum their last 
  fragments of coal before plunging into the eternal ice.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">Tradition and universal agreement have been taken as foundations of 
  criticism. Neither one exists. It is true that an almost general opinion 
  favors certain works. But it does so by virtue of a prejudice and not at all 
  through choice and the effect of a spontaneous preference. The works which 
  everybody admires are those which no one looks at. One receives them like a 
  precious burden which one hands on to others without looking at it. Do you 
  really believe that there is much freedom of judgment in the approbation which 
  we give to the Greek, the Latin or even the French classics? And is the taste 
  which draws us to a certain contemporary work and away from some other really 
  free? Is it not determined by many circumstances quite alien to the content of 
  the work, the chief of which is the spirit of imitation so powerful both among 
  men and beasts? That spirit of imitation is necessary to us to help us live 
  without too much disorder; we carry it into all our actions and it dominates 
  our aesthetic sense. Without it our opinions in matters of art would be even 
  more diverse than they are. It is in this way that some work which, for some 
  reason or other, has, to begin with, gained the suffrages of some, will 
  thereupon gather those of many. The first alone were free; all the others did 
  nothing but obey. They have neither spontaneity, nor insight, nor courage, nor 
  any character. And their multiplication creates fame. It all depends on a very 
  small beginning. One also observes that works despised at their birth have 
  little chance of pleasing later, and that on the contrary works celebrated 
  from their appearance will long guard their reputation and be respected even 
  after they have become unintelligible. The utter dependence of agreement upon 
  prejudice is proved by the fact that they cease together. Numerous instances 
  of this could be given....</font></P>
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">What an interesting book could be written on the variations of criticism 
  concerning one of those works with which men have most busied 
  themselves--Hamlet, the Divine Comedy, the Iliad. The Iliad charms us to-day 
  by a barbarous and primitive character which we discover in it in all good 
  faith. In the seventeenth century Homer was praised for having observed the 
  rules of epic composition.</font></P>
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You may be sure," Boileau said, "that if Homer used the word 'dog' it is 
  because 'dog' is a noble word in Greek."</font></P>
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">Such ideas seem absurd to us. Ours may seem equally absurd in two hundred 
  years. For after all, one cannot rank amid the eternal verities the perception 
  that Homer is primitive and that primitive barbarism is admirable. There is 
  not a single opinion in literature which one cannot easily fight with its 
  precise opposite. Who, then, will be able to end the disputes of the 
  flute-players?</font></P>
