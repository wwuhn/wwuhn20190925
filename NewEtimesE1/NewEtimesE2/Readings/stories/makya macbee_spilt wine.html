<p><font face="Times New Roman">The glass slipped out of her hand.  For a brief moment she was brought
to life.  She turned her head and watched the glass fall.  How slowly
it fell.  Inside, her mind was consumed, but outside, she only
thought and how slowly it fell.  It seemed she could catch it if she only
reached out, but somehow she could only watch it fall.</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Times New Roman">She hadn't planned on coming at all.  Beth had said she must.  It would
be just fabulous, and besides, she just didn't get out enough.  She
preferred to stay at home.  It was such a big house for just herself,
but it never seemed lonely to her.  She liked the house so much better
now, still and quiet.  She rather enjoyed being home alone; there were
no needs to meet but her own.  She would never tell anybody, but she
could not imagine a single reason why she should be worse off now.  She
wished she had stayed home tonight.  But Beth was a friend of the
family (what a strange way to put it) and had a way of making her feel
like she was wrong.  So she had come.  Come to some people she didn't
know, to some house she didn't know, to spill wine on their carpet.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">On the way to the party, Beth didn't stop talking.  At first (a little
over a year ago now) when Beth would come over to talk, she didn't
mind.  Always sympathetic, always with a cake or flowers, Beth would
come.  Beth was truly sorry, seemed to want to help her, to be a
friend, though she needed none.  In truth, Beth was no more a friend
than anyone else, just more tolerable.  But it became annoying when
Beth would say, &quot;You don't go out enough; you should come to lunch
sometime; really, are you feeling okay?&quot;</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Like Beth, everyone had said she was taking it so well, that it was
easier because they hadn't had children.  She heard their voices; she
would respond, but she was distant.  And now, now she only existed for
herself.  She would have been perfectly content to be by herself, live
her life as she'd have it lived and unaffected by others.  But Beth had
said that she must go, and she cared too little to argue.  She never
argued with Beth's assumptions and it seemed too much trouble.  She was
careful though, not to let Beth see her too happy.  &quot;That dress,&quot; Beth
had said only days after the funeral, &quot;You haven't worn it in years.&quot;
She had mumbled some explanation, not knowing herself why she'd chosen
to wear it, but remembering what she'd always known and how important it
was to keep up appearances.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Beth, of course, would think going to this party the best way to keep
up appearances.  Beth who said, &quot;It's been a year now, you've got to
get on with your life.&quot;  Beth who tended to say many of the right
things, for all of the wrong reasons.  Beth who now said, &quot;How good it
is for you to get out,&quot; as they drove to the party.  &quot;It will be just
fabulous.  An old friend of mine and William Kerns and is going to be there.  I
really think you'll like him.  He's divorced, no children, a doctor.
How nice it will be, or,&quot; Beth questioned, &quot;is it too soon to talk like
that?&quot;</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">On the couch, he sat down and began a conversation with her.  He was a
doctor.  Yes, she nodded.  How was she getting along?  Fine, it had
been over a year now, she was fine.  He touched her shoulder,
consoling, condescending; reflex and she pulled away.  He continued to
speak and she wondered at how male his voice was.  Commanding and
persuasive. It meant little to her.  Why was everyone so concerned with
her?  She was never concerned with them.  As he spoke her hand moved to
rest on her knee.  She remembered a scrape she'd had there.  She had
fallen in the bedroom; she thought of how nicely it had healed.  She
thought of how much the human body endured.  How many times small
children will fall, but always their scrapes and bruises heal.  It was
amazing to her, that so much could ever heal.  When she was a child she
had broken her arm on the swingset.  Her father pushed her so high; she
called for him to stop but he must not have heard her for he pushed
again.  Her small, frightened body shuddered and slipped and she landed on
her arm.  Such pain, yet now she easily used that same arm to lift her
wine to her mouth.  Her arm had healed and this amazed her.  It amazed her
that her bruises always healed.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Again, she noticed he was speaking.  She would nod, or say a word or
two; it was all that she wanted.  His voice could have been any man's
voice and they all seemed the same to her now.  And as he spoke his eyes
moved over her; she would not think of this though; she would think of
other things, and she would not look at his eyes.  She felt the curve
of her glass, how fragile it was.  She remembered, as a child, breaking
a glass and and being very afraid.  Of what she could not say, but it still
frightened her.  She could hear the sound of breaking glass, from not
long ago, breaking glass and an angry voice.  How could so many bad
memories be caught up in a glass, and she thought, why?  Last week she
had broken a plate.  It was wet, and she had dropped it.  Her entire
body had flinched; a chill had run through her, but then she remembered
and almost smiled.  Now it was only a plate, she had thought, so she
broke another to convince herself of the safety.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">But now she was at a party, and there was a man talking to her.  She
did not much like him; she couldn't imagine how she would.  She was
thinking of leaving when he turned to her and said, &quot;Your eyes are
beautiful.&quot;  Her body shuddered; a familiar chill enveloped her; she
dropped the glass.  She turned to watch the glass fall as those words
rippled through her.  Your eyes are beautiful. She'd heard those words
before: as a child, as a wife.  She could not stand to hear those words
again.  Memories she'd kept hidden for too long rushed on her; like
fire they spread and engulfed her in a silent horror.  The glass did
not shatter; only the wine spilt, leaving a streak of red.</font><p>
