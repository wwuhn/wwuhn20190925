The following story appears in the book, VOICES FROM THE THAI COUNTRYSIDE: THE 
SHORT STORIES OF SAMRUAM SINGH, edited and translated by Katherine A. Bowie, 
published by Center for Southeast Asian Studies, U of Wisconsin, Madison, 1991.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The soft billowing green of planted 
paddyfields gives most people who look at them a feeling of harmony and renewal. 
But there is another group of people who can hardly wait for the rice and other 
crops of silver and gold to disappear from the land as quickly as possible. They 
have no interest in whether crop yields are high or low, or whether there are 
any yields at all.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Because once the crops have been harvested and 
removed from the fields, the lands that appear useless once again become public 
property. Anyone can go and gather animals and plants of all kinds without 
owners getting upset. Lizards, mice, toads, frogs, fish, and even dung-beetles 
have been the delicacies of the poor for generations. In addition, there are 
edible plants of all descriptions, such as, haew, phak bung, phak waen, phak 
khiikhuang, and phak ihin. These plants and animals have never had landlords or 
tenants disputing ownership over them.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman">This rainy season, just before the farmers began plowing up the land and before
the young people came home from their jobs in the city, Kham had been able to
catch fish in the paddyfields than ever before. He had sold so many fish that he
had accumulated quite a sum of money. After consulting with Paa Phuang, his life
partner, Lung Kham was finally able to buy something he had wanted for as long
as he could remember. He had wanted it so badly that he had already given up
attaining it in this lifetime.</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Every other rainy season Lung Kham had despaired, thinking if he only had a Mida
lathern, he would be certain to find more fish than anyone else. The best way to
find fish in the paddyfields was with a light to illuminate the water and a
finely woven cage in which to trap the fish as they lay sleeping in the night.
But with the dim light from his tin-can kerosene lamp and vision blurred with
age, he could not rival the youngsters who used bright Mida lanterns.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Many of his neighbors watched jealously as Lung Kham stroked, touched, caressed,
and polished his brand-new Mida lantern that he had just bought from Chinaman
Mong for nearly 300 Baht. Actually his lantern was a different brand than Mida,
but everyone still called it by that name anyway, including Chinaman Mong.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">He was so engrossed, so enraptured with his new Mida that Paa Phuang finally had
to remind him to go back and check the fish traps that he had set earlier.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">It was long after they had finished supper that evening when Paa Phuang finally
decided to permit Daeng, their eldest son who was just entering fourth grade
that year, to go fishing with his father.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Daeng had begged to go fishing at night with his fathere many times before, but
both Lung Kaham and Paa Phuang had told him the same thing each time. The glow
of a single kerosene lamp wasn't sufficient to light the way for both Daeng and
his father at the same time.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">After getting dressed, with some delays lighting the lantern, father and son
left home, setting off for the paddyfields. The fields had already been partly
plowed, so there were no more weeds left; it would be easier now to see the
fish.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">The lights of different kinds of lanterns of the other fish hunters twinkled all
over the horizon and were redoubled by their reflection in the mirror-still
water.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Lung Kham carried the lantern in his left hand and a fish cage in his right. A
large basket to hold the captured fish hung over his hip. Ever so carefully he
took one step after the other, wading cautiously in the calf- deep water. Daeng
carried his bamboo fish cage in his left hand. In his right hand he carried a
big knife about a half-meter in length. He walked on the left hand side of his
father and just as cautiously. </font> <p>

<font face="Times New Roman">The gazes of both were transfixed, peering into the water. Their ears hardly
heard the sound of frogs and toads croaking noisily about them in all
directions. Dozens of fish-eater snes stuck their heads out of the water,
motionless. They stared imperviously at their two human competitors, who in turn
viewed them with equally little emotion.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Daeng, you can't use the cage for eels or scorpion fish, or they will escape.
You have to stun them with the knife. Come down straight on top of their heads
with all your might. Cut through the water with the sharp edge of the knife, not
the broad side. Here, I'll show you how.&quot;</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">The young red-colored eel the width of a thumb lay stretched out full-length in
the water, so still it seemed to be already dead. They sharp edge of the knife
came down on its neck, driving its head into the soft mud. It jerked around in
every direction, muddying the water. Before the surrounding water could clear,
the eel had been picked up and put into the basket of the little boy.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;In a little while, it will recover. Now it's your turn. Why don't you practice
hitting a scorpion fish first. If you see any eels, tell me. If I let you try
eels already, there's chance you'll hit it so hard it may die. Then we can't get
a good price for it. You have to hit them just right. You can't let any marks
show either. And don't do anything careless like hitting a snake. Look carefully
before you strike. If you hit a snake, it means that all night long we'll have
not hope of catching any more fish. harming snakes brings bad luck.&quot;</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Daeng, Daeng! Come here quickly and hold the Mida for me. Here's full-grown duk
fish. They're very hard to catch. Other fish you just have to trap under the
cage and then reach in and grab them. But duk fish of this size take patience.
Sometimes you have to wait a long time for the right moment to grab them.
Otherwise they can give you a wound that throbs for days.&quot;</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">******</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">The planting of the paddyfields marks the end of the golden age for villagers
such as Lun Kham. Then the fertile womb of the paddyfields, which had been
virtually public domain, reverts to private property. The owners guard their
individual plots jealously, lest the tender rice seedlings be harmed. No longer
can anyone roam through the waters looking for fish. Lung Kham and others of his
class knew this unwritten law of their fellow villagers only too well and never
thought to violate it.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Only a single patch of swamp located at the far edge of the paddyfields
remained out of all of Lung Kham's fishing places; it, too, would dry up in the
dry season. Then he would have to walk along the bunds in the paddyfields,
taking his beloved lantern. He would also take along another implement, a bamboo
stick the width of his index finger and about one meter long. It forked tip was
interwoven with bamboo into a board used for hitting frogs.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Lung Kham didn't like earning a living by catching frogs. The frogs' expression
when hit on the head was awful. It tormented him to see their tears flow and
their front legs reach up to their eyes to wipe them away. But Lung Kham and
others in his position had ever fewer choices.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">The night arrived that Lung Kham knew was the last night he could hunt fish in
the paddyfields before he would have to change his form of livelihood to
foraging in the forest. That night his basket had fewer fish, crabs, frogs, and
clams than ever, so few that he feared they would not make up for the cost of
the kerosene he was using for his lantern.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">As he paused to set the lantern on the path through the paddyfield to pump more
air into it, he caught sight of chohn fish. It was as wide as his wrist. Hiding
among the ricestalks now over half a meter high, it lays so still that one
almost might not thinks it was a fish. Lung Kham hesitated for a moment. If he
used his fishtrap, he was afraid that, in the process, he might damage some of
the rice shoots. Instead, he decided to get a firm grasp on his knife and came
down with all his might on its head. He made such a loud noise that he startled
even himself. The water became murky with mud and blood, but the chohn fish was
no longer there. Instead, the sound of the writhing fish came from the middle of
the ricefield. Lung Kham set off after the fish. He carefully waded between the
rows of planted ricestalks, looking right and left, careful not to injure any of
the seedlings, not wanting any of the plants to be damaged by him.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Suddenly a gunshot rang out across the paddyfields. The lantern in his hand
shattered. He was terrified. A cold shiver ran down his spine. His heart
fluttered. When he came to his sense, he took off running for dear life, his two
legs so light that he didn't notice them. The rice shoots in his path were
trampled underfoot. From the distance, he heard voice yelling out after him.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You cur! Trampling everything down! So it's you who have been ruining the rice!
Now I'll have to replant it all over again, and I don't have enough money to buy
more seedlings. If I find you again, I'll shoot you dead!&quot;</font><p>


<font face="Times New Roman">The publisher's note on the author:</font><p><p>
<font face="Times New Roman">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing under the pseudonym Samruam Singh, the Thai author Surasighsamruam
Shimbhanao wrote the stories in this collection during the mid-1970's, a decade
of dramatic social and political change in Thailand. An activist dedicated to
improving the lives of the disadvantaged, Surasingh wrote these stories to
convey the agony of the Thai countryside under the pressure of accelerated
social and economic change. They are vignettes from the daily lives of ordinary
villagers. Read as a collection, they offer stark testimony about a troubled
period in Thai history.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Surasingh wrote these stories for the progressive magazine JATURAT, a liberal
voice for democracy that was silenced after the return of military rule in 1976.
At the time, Surasingh was working in northern Thailand as a free- lance
journalist and teaching a a local college. Journalistic constraints, the threat
of censorship, and political pressure forced him to fictionalize factual
accounts, thereby creating a style sympathetic to to New Journalism then popular
in the United States.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">Surasingh stands in first rank of Thai writers. In 1979 the magazine Lok
Nangsyyawarded him the Cho Karaket Prize for his short story &quot;The Necklace.&quot;</font><p>


<font face="Times New Roman">My own note:</font><p><p>
<font face="Times New Roman">~~~~~~~~~~~~

The book contains 11 more stories witthe introduction part which describes the
historical context of the 1970's Thailand; the notion of Literature for Life;
The Freedom of Fiction, and; The Art of Fiction. The book illustrations are
created by Jongrak Siritan, a graphic artist who currently resides in Chicago.
Jongrak was born in Sanpatong District, Chiangmai. He, Surasingh, and Katherine
Bowie met there and became friends.</font><p>

<font face="Times New Roman">If I am not totally caught in the course of my study, I will try to continue the
effort of posting this kind of literary works. Let me know what you guys think!</font><p>
