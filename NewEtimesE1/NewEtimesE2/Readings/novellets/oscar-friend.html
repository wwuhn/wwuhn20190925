<HR SIZE=1>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. He had 
bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers, and his tail was like a long 
bit of black India-rubber. The little ducks were swimming about in the 
pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who 
was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand 
on their heads in the water. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,' 
she kept saying to them; and every now and there she showed them how it was 
done. But the little ducks paid no attention to her. They were so young that 
they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`What disobedient children! cried the old Water-rat; `they really deserve to 
be drowned.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Nothing of the kind,' answered the Duck, `every one must make a beginning, 
and parents cannot be too patient.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,' said the Water-rat; `I am 
not a family man. In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be. 
Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher. Indeed, I know 
of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted 
friendship.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?' asked a 
Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the 
conversation. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Yes, that is just what I want to know,' said the Duck, and she swam away to 
the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a 
good example. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`What a silly question! cried the Water-rat. `I should expect my devoted 
friend to be devoted to me, of course.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`And what would you do in return?' said the little bird, swinging upon a 
silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`I don't understand you,' answered the Water-rat.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Let me tell you a story on the subject,' said the Linnet.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Is the story about me?' asked the Water-rat. `If so, I will listen to it, 
for I am extremely fond of fiction.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`It is applicable to you,' answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and 
alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Once upon a time,' said the Linnet, `there was an honest little fellow named 
Hans.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Was he very distinguished?' asked the Water-rat.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`No,' answered the Linnet, `I don't think he was distinguished at all, except 
for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face. He lived in a tiny 
cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden. In all the 
country-side there was no garden so lovely as his. Sweet-William grew there, and 
Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France. There were 
damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and 
white. Columbine and Lady Smock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the 
Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their 
proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so 
that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to 
smell. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was 
big Hugh the Miller. Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that 
he would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a 
large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums 
and cherries if it was the fruit season. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Real friends should have everything in common,&quot; the Miller used to say, and 
little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such 
noble ideas. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller 
never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of 
flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly 
sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him 
greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to 
say about the unselfishness of true friendship. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`So little Hans worked away in his garden. During the spring, the summer, and 
the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or 
flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a brood deal from cold and hunger 
and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard 
nuts. In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to 
see him then. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,&quot; 
the Miller used to say to his wife, &quot;for when people are in trouble they should 
be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors. That at least is my idea about 
friendship, and I am sure I am right. So I shall wait till the spring comes, and 
then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of 
primroses, and that will make him so happy.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;You are certainly very thoughtful about others,&quot; answered the Wife, as she 
sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood tire; `very thoughtful 
indeed. It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship. I am sure the 
clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, through he does 
live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.&quot;
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;But could we riot ask little Hans up here?&quot; said the Miller's youngest son. 
&quot;If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my 
white rabbits.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;What a silly boy you are!&quot; cried the Miller; &quot;I really don't know what is 
the use of sending you to school. You seem not to learn anything. Why, if little 
Hans came up here, and saw our warm tire, and our good supper, and our great 
cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and 
would spoil anybody's nature. I certainly will not allow Hans's nature to be 
spoiled. I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he 
is not led into any temptations. Besides, if Hans came here, he night ask me to 
let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do. Flour is one thing, 
and friendship is another, and they should not be confused. Why, the words are 
spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that.&quot;
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;How well you talk!&quot; said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large 
glass of warm ale; &quot;really I feel quite drowsy. It is just like being in 
church.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Lots of people act well,&quot; answered the Miller; &quot;but very few people talk 
well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and 
much the finer thing also;&quot; and he looked sternly across the table at his little 
son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite 
scarlet, and began to cry into his tea. However, he was so young that you must 
excuse him.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Is that the end of the story?' asked the Water-rat.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Certainly not,' answered the Linnet, `that is the beginning.'
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Then you are quite behind the age,' said the Water-rat.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to 
the beginning, and concludes with the middle. That is the new method. I heard 
all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a 
young man. He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have 
been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young 
man made any remark, he always answered &quot;Pooh!&quot; But pray go on with your story. 
I like the Miller immensely. I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself so 
there is a great sympathy between us.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Well,' said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, `as 
soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow 
stars, the miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Why, what a good heart you have!&quot; cried his Wife; &quot;you are always thinking 
of others. And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.&quot;
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron 
chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Good morning, little Hans,&quot; said the Miller.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to 
ear. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;And how have you been all the winter?&quot; said the Miller.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, really,&quot; cried Hans, &quot;it is very good of you to ask, very good 
indeed. I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, 
and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,&quot; said the Miller, &quot;and 
wondered how you were getting on.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;That was kind of you,&quot; said Hans; &quot;I was half afraid you had forgotten me.&quot;
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Hans, I am surprised at you,&quot; said the Miller; &quot;friendship never forgets. 
That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the 
poetry of life. How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;They are certainly very lovely,&quot; said Hans, &quot;and it is a most lucky thing 
for me that I have so many. I am going to bring them into the market and sell 
them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.&quot;
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Buy back your wheelbarrow? You don't mean to say you have sold it? What a 
very stupid thing to do!&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, the fact is,&quot; said Hans, &quot;that I was obliged to. You see the winter 
was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with. 
So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver 
chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow. But I am 
going to buy them all back again now.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Hans,&quot; said the Miller, &quot;I will give you my wheelbarrow. It is not in very 
good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the 
wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you. I know it is very 
generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for 
parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world. I think that 
generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new 
wheelbarrow for myself. Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my 
wheelbarrow.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, really, that is generous of you,&quot; said little Hans, and his funny 
round face glowed all over with pleasure. &quot;I can easily put it in repair, as I 
have a plank of wood in the house.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;A plank of wood! said the Miller; &quot;why, that is just what I want for the 
roof of my barn. There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get 
damp if I don't stop it up. How lucky you mentioned it! It is quite remarkable 
how one good action always breeds another. I have given you my wheelbarrow, and 
now you are going to give me your plank. Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far 
more than the plank, but true friendship never notices things like that. Pray 
get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the 
plank out. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;It is not a very big plank,&quot; said the Miller, looking at it, &quot;and I am 
afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to 
mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. And now, as I 
have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers 
in return. Here is the basket, and mind you till it quite full.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Quite full? said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very 
big basket, and he knew that if he tilled it he would have no flowers left for 
the market, and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, really,&quot; answered the Miller, &quot;as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I 
don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers. I may be wrong, but I 
should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from 
selfishness of any kind.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;My dear friend, my best friend,&quot; cried little Hans, &quot;you are welcome to all 
the flowers in my garden. I would much sooner have your good opinion than my 
silver buttons, any day;&quot; and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and 
tilled the Miller's basket. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Good-bye, little Hans,&quot; said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the 
plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was 
so pleased about the wheelbarrow. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he 
heard the Miller's voice calling to him from the road. So he jumped off the 
ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Dear little Hans,&quot; said the Miller, &quot;would you mind carrying this sack of 
flour for me to market?&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Oh, I am so sorry,&quot; said Hans, &quot;but I am really very busy to-day. I have 
got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to 
roll.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, really,&quot; said the Miller, &quot;I think that, considering that I am going 
to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.&quot;
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Oh, don't say that,&quot; cried little Hans, &quot;I wouldn't be unfriendly for the 
whole world;&quot; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on 
his shoulders. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had 
reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest. 
However, he went on bravely, and at last he reached the market. After he had 
waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and 
then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he 
might meet some robbers on the way. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;It has certainly been a hard day,&quot; said little Hans to himself as he was 
going to bed, &quot;but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best 
friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of 
flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Upon my word,&quot; said the Miller, &quot;you are very lazy. Really, considering 
that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. 
Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle 
or sluggish. You must riot mind my speaking quite plainly to you. Of course I 
should not dream of doing so if I were riot your friend. But what is the good of 
friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? Anybody can say charming 
things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says 
unpleasant things, and does riot mind giving pain. Indeed, if he is a really 
true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;I am very sorry,&quot; said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his 
night-cap, &quot;but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little 
time, and listen to the birds singing. Do you know that I always work better 
after hearing the birds sing?&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, I am glad of that,&quot; said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the 
back, &quot;for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and 
mend my barn-roof for me.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his 
flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the 
Miller, as he was such a good friend to him. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?&quot; he 
inquired in a shy and timid voice. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, really,&quot; answered the Miller, &quot;I do not think it is much to ask of 
you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if 
you refuse I will go and do it myself.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Oh! on no account,&quot; cried little Hans; and he jumped out of bed, and 
dressed himself and went up to the barn. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to 
see how he was getting on. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?&quot; cried the Miller in 
a cheery voice. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;It is quite mended,&quot; answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Ah!&quot; said the Miller, &quot;there is no work so delightful as the work one does 
for others.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,&quot; answered little Hans, 
sitting down and wiping his forehead, &quot;a very great privilege. But I am afraid I 
shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Oh! they will come to you,&quot; said the Miller, &quot;but you must take more pains. 
At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the 
theory also.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Do you really think I shall?&quot; asked little Hans.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;I have no doubt of it,&quot; answered the Miller; &quot;but now that you have mended 
the roof you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to 
the mountain to-morrow.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next 
morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off 
with them to the mountain. It took him the whole day to get there and back; and 
when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did 
not wake up till it was broad daylight. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,&quot; he said, and he went to 
work at once. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his 
friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, 
or getting him to help at the mill. Little Hans was very much distressed at 
times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he 
consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend. 
&quot;Besides,&quot; he used to say, &quot;he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is 
an act of pure generosity.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of 
beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used 
to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside 
when a loud rap came at the door. It was a very wild right, and the wind was 
blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was 
merely the storm. But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than either of 
the others. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;It is some poor traveller,&quot; said little Hans to himself and he ran to the 
door. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the 
other. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Dear little Hans,&quot; cried the Miller, &quot;I am in great trouble. My little boy 
has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself and I am going for the Doctor. But he 
lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me 
that it would be much better if you went instead of me. You know I am going to 
give you my wheelbarrow, and so it is only fair that you should do something for 
me in return.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Certainly,&quot; cried little Hans, &quot;I take it quite as a compliment your coming 
to me, and I will start off at once. But you must lend me your lantern, as the 
night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;I am very sorry,&quot; answered the Miller, &quot;but it is my new lantern, and it 
would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Well, never mind, I will do without it,&quot; cried little Hans, and he took 
down his great fur coat, and tied a muffler round his throat, and started off.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`What a dreadful storm it was! The night was so black that little Hans could 
hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand. However, he 
was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived 
at the Doctor's house, and knocked at the door. &quot;`Who is there?&quot; cried the 
Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Little Hans, Doctor.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;What do you want, little Hans?&quot;
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself and the 
Miller wants you to come at once.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;All right! said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, 
and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the 
Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and 
little Hans could riot see where he was going, or keep up with the horse. At 
last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous 
place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned. His 
body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of 
water, and was brought back by them to the cottage. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Everybody went to little Hans's funeral, as he was so popular, and the 
Miller was the chief mourner. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;As I was his best friend,&quot; said the Miller, &quot;it is only fair that I should 
have the best place;&quot; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black 
cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,&quot; said the Blacksmith, 
when the funeral was over, and they were all seated comfortably in the inn, 
drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`&quot;A great loss to me at any rate,&quot; answered the Miller; &quot;why, I had as good 
as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don't know what to do with it. It 
is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not 
get anything for it if I sold it. I will certainly take care not to give away 
anything again. One always suffers for being generous.&quot;' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Well?' said the Water-rat, after a long pause.

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Well, that is the end,' said the Linnet. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`But what became of the Miller?' asked the Water-rat.
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Oh! I really don't know,' replied the Linnet; `and I am sure that I don't 
care.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,' said the 
Water-rat. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`I am afraid you don't quite see the moral of the story,' remarked the 
Linnet. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`The what?' screamed the Water-rat. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`The moral.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?'
</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Certainly,' said the Linnet. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Well, really,' said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, `I think you 
should have told me that before you began. If you had done so, I certainly would 
not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said &quot;Pooh,&quot; like the critic. 
However, I can say it now; so he shouted out `Pooh' at the top of his voice, 
gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole. </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`And how do you like the Water-rat?' asked the Duck, who came paddling up 
some minutes afterwards. `He has a great many good points, but for my own part I 
have a mother's feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without 
the tears coming into my eyes.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,' answered the Linnet. `The fact 
is, that I told him a story with a moral.' </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">`Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,' said the Duck.
</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And I quite agree with her.</font></p>
