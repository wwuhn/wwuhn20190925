  <p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">My former roommate, Trevor Hanscome, played one of the life-sized animated characters that either delight or terrify little kids at
amusement parks.  He was Riverside's Millie the Muskrat character, the park's kindhearted mascot, and protagonist of a short-lived Saturday
morning cartoon series.  Trevor died two weeks ago.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Every morning at eight o'clock Trevor would don the one hundred pound
muskrat costume and take the elevator up from the subterranean dressing
room to ground level.  Temperatures in Springfield at eight o'clock in
the morning in August can reach seventy degrees.  The air temperature
inside of Millie's mask at two o'clock in the afternoon can reach one
hundred twenty degrees. Trevor worked up to ten hours a day and made
six fifty-five an hour.  He lived Millie.  He rarely took breaks.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Warner Brothers sometimes used Riverside as a laboratory for testing
new cartoon characters.  New characters are equipped with a microphone
and video camera to record children's' reactions to say, a turtle in a
space suit, or a giant spotted cow in overalls. Then Warner Brothers
has its child psychologists analyze the tapes.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Largely due to Trevor's work as Millie, Warner Bothers decided that the
Muskrat would be an enormous success as a Saturday morning cartoon.
The show flopped, and the networks took Millie off the air after three
episodes.  Millie, the story went, was a vagabond who travelled the
rivers of the world with his companion Pierre, a red- winged blackbird
with a thick French accent.  Besides offering the kids a geography
lesson every weekend, the two animals were friendly, courteous, and
unconditionally accepting of everyone they met in their travels.  The
big problem with the cartoon, Warner Brothers later concluded, was that
Millie and Pierre were too nice, sickeningly nice, and as a result
extremely boring compared to the competing time slots.  Millie was by
far the most virtuous character Warner Brothers had ever created.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Nonetheless, children visiting the park loved the larger-than-life
muskrat, and Riverside decided to keep Millie among the cast of park
creatures, and to keep Trevor playing Millie.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">I had only been in Springfield, Massachusetts for a few weeks before I
met Trevor.  I had a spare room, and the rent was too high for me alone
anyway.  I knew no one in the city, and just out of college I missed
the camaraderie of a roommate, so I invited Trevor to live with me.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">I met him on a bus.  He had been living at the YMCA for four months,
and he was posting fliers in hopes of finding somewhere else to live.
Privacy was important to Trevor.  The fliers read &quot;Homeless, confused
and beset by despair.&quot;  The sign had been written quickly in permanent
magic marker and duplicated on some dirty office copier.  Stray dots of
toner speckled sections of each page.  In smaller print were the words,
&quot;Need Apartment,&quot; a name, Trevor Hanscome, and a phone number.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor had not yet begun to post the fliers.  He was asleep now, on the
inside seat, slumped over and leaning against the bus window.  His
unwashed black hair splayed out across the pane.  I had been watching
him for twenty minutes or so.  He had been sitting at the back of the
crowded bus for several stops.  He was waiting, I gathered, for a
window seat.  A bag lady sat down next to him and chattered happily to
herself over her soiled Filene's bags.  A window seat opened up, but
Trevor hesitated.  He glanced at the bag lady and remained seated for
several minutes before sheepishly moving to the vacant seat.  When
another window seat opened up he moved again, looking toward the back
of the bus, hoping the bag lady would notice.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">The bus stopped at a crosswalk, blew its horn at a pedestrian and its
driver cursed.  Trevor jerked forward with the motion of the vehicle.
His eyes popped open, stared dazedly down the aisle for a moment, and
then shifted to the window.  He remained hunched over, forehead pressed
against the glass, watching the sidewalk. He got off the bus at the
next stop and I followed him.  I tapped him on the shoulder.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hey,&quot; I said, &quot;I need a roommate.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He turned around and stared at me, and seeing his face that close made
me jump.  For an instant I had the urge to withdraw my offer.  He was
skinny, skinny in an unhealthy way.  He had two deep, dark eye-sockets,
and his cheeks sunk in so that he looked like an old lady when he
sucked the smoke out of his cigarettes. During the two months that
Trevor lived with me, I never saw him eat, never saw him drink.  He
smoked at least two packs a day, never in our apartment, always outside
or at work.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You got a video cassette recorder?&quot; he asked.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">I hesitated, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He kept his eyes on mine.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Okay,&quot; he said.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He moved in the next day.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;So, Trevor, how did you get into this business?&quot; I asked as he moved
his three milk crates and two suitcases worth of of possessions into
the apartment.  &quot;I used to work for Disney,&quot; he said, &quot;They fired me.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He told me the story.  On a one hundred and four degree day, Trevor
collapsed from dehydration.  A park monitor found him slumped against a
plastic tree in Tomorrowland, with his Goofy mask off, and a trail of
vomit running down Goofy's tie.  Disney's animated characters are
strictly forbidden to appear out of costume.  Goofy, Disney complained,
could absolutely not be seen removing his head and throwing up on
himself.  Park characters nearly always travel with chaperons who can
attend to their needs, but Disney was short staffed at the time.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You didn't protest?&quot; I asked. </font>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor stared into one of the milk crates.  &quot;I fucked up,&quot; he said.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor had played nearly every &quot;full suit&quot; at Disney World. The &quot;full
suits&quot;, Trevor explained to me, are the costumes with masks.  The &quot;half
suits&quot;, and there are not many of them, tend to have more realistic
facial features that require only makeup.  Snow White or Prince
Charming, for example, are half suit characters. Trevor always played
full suits.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He brought with him video-cassettes containing twenty-two Millie the
Muskrat episodes, all that Warner Brothers had ever filmed. Trevor had
no real interest in acting, but he played his roles with zeal.  He
spent hours studying a character's cartoons, imitating the creatures'
movements and gestures with meticulous care.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">And from what I could see Trevor wasn't comfortable around kids.  My
sister once came to town one weekend with her four-  and six-year-old
boys.  She got a room at a nearby hotel and the kids spent the night at
my place.  While the kids were thrilled to spend the weekend with
Millie the Muskrat, Trevor seemed horrified.  He trembled and sweat
profusely around them.  He avoided all contact with them.  But being
kids, they took a liking to him regardless, and did all they could to
try to engage him in their activities. After the six-year-old grabbed
his leg and tried to wrestle him to the ground, Trevor locked himself
in his room for the rest of the weekend.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">I would often come home in the evenings to find Trevor sitting in front
of the television watching Millie or another of his character's
episodes.  That's the way I found him two weeks ago, on the night
before he died.  He sat Indian-style on the floor in front of the TV,
the only light in the room coming from the picture tube.  He clicked on
the weather channel.  The weather man was pointing at five or six
computer icons of smiling suns superimposed over Missouri, Iowa, and
Nebraska.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Clearing,&quot; said the weather man, &quot;in the Midwest, and diminishing
danger of flooding.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor pointed at the screen and turned to get my attention,
&quot;Son-of-a-bitch,&quot; he said, &quot;Irresponsible son-of-a-bitch.  How many
people will see this and decide not to leave their homes tonight,
decide not to worry about the river?  Because of this idiot's reading,
his interpretation of some computerized radar readout, he's putting
thousands of people in jeopardy, influencing their decisions as to
whether or not to prepare sandbags.  Say Mrs. Jones in Iowa is worried
to death about these floods.  She tells her husband her shoulder hurts,
and for the last ten years, she says, her shoulder has always started
to ache before a storm.  But Mr. Jones doesn't give in to
superstitions; he has always prided himself on being a pragmatist, and
his neighbors respect him for that.  Plus, he thinks, my wife's a
worrywart, she tends to exaggerate.  So tuning his new satellite dish
that he told his wife would pay for itself tenfold within the first
five years, he finds this idiot on the weather channel.  Nothing to
worry about,' Jones thinks.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Then Jones' neighbor calls to ask his advice.  His neighbor's a young
guy with a new wife and baby. He can't even afford a decent radio, not to
mention a TV and a satellite dish.  Mr. Jones says not to worry, his
wife's all riled up about nothing and that no fool would waste the time
and energy packing up and leaving.  Now this neighbor values Jones'
opinion after all Jones has been in the area longer, he's got a sense
for these things.  He certainly wouldn't want to risk Jones laughing at
him when he's throwing all his gear together and getting his family all
upset for no reason at all.  So they all stay put.  Jones puts himself
to sleep with a bottle of bourbon, his wife lies trembling in bed, his
neighbor and his family fall asleep tranquilly, and they all get swept
away when the rains hit and the river rises. An unexpected change in
the weather pattern,' says the weatherman.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;They're pretty good at predicting the weather,&quot; I said, &quot;Meteorologists
are scientists after all, like doctors.  I wouldn't worry about Jones
and his neighbor, Trev.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh please,&quot; he scoffed, &quot;If your liberal arts education taught you
anything, you should know that you can't prove anything with any
certainty.  No proof is absolute.  They teach you to respect every
position.  But if any fucking theory is as good as the next, none is
better than any other.  We're taught to be accepting of all, and the
result is we can deny none.  Every theory, every theory is imperfect.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor had graduated from an expensive private college in Pennsylvania
two years ago.  His parents begged him to find other work.  They called
periodically.  I heard him tell them several times that he liked his
job, that it gave him direction and that people our age should be
grateful to have such direction.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He stood up slowly, clicked off the TV and continued, &quot;And doctors,
Christ, doctors are the worst.  Medicine is based on theory, biology is
based on theory, chemistry on theory.  A diagnosis is a theory.  There
is always a margin of error.  There is always that risk.  I haven't
been to a doctor since I was thirteen.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Occasionally he would launch into these tirades, but they weren't for
my benefit.  Trevor was generally a quiet roommate, very private.  So
the next day, when he called me on my lunch hour and invited me to meet
him in his dressing room, I accepted.  Riverside is only about ten
minutes away from my office.  I took the bus and used the staff
entrance as Trevor had instructed me.  Riverside was packed.  It was
one of the hottest days of the summer.  The enormous scrolling digital
sign that announced the day's events at the park said ninety-eight
degrees.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">A centenarian guard in a mock police man's uniform ushered me into a
freight elevator that would take me to the underground dressing rooms.
All the workings of Riverside were underground. The guard shut the gate
on the elevator, smiled toothlessly, and pulled a lever that sent me
lurching down into the bowels of Riverside Park.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">I opened the gate and made my way through the network of dimly lit
underground tunnels, following the signs shaped like hands with shirt
cuffs and pointing fingers, indicating the direction of the dressing
rooms.  Life-sized Wile E. Coyote and Tasmanian Devil torsos with tiny
human heads passed me.  I asked a cat-like creature I didn't recognize
where I could find Trevor Hanscome.  A muffled voice came through the
cloth- covered tracheotomy hole in the cat's neck, &quot;Trevor's in room
forty-two.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">I looked into the open dressing rooms as I passed.  A circus clown
soaked his feet in a tub of water as he leafed through a girlie
magazine and took long pulls from a flask.  A few characters sat in a
lounge and watched television.  Some slept sitting upright in their
dressing-room chairs.  Others smoked in the hallway.  They were an ugly
bunch, sweaty, unshaven.  The stench in the place was terrible.
Condensation dripped from the ceiling and down the walls, striping the
bare concrete.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor was not in his dressing room.  I took a seat opposite the door
and waited.  Ten minutes later he appeared in the doorway, his
sweat-soaked head looking detached from his furry brown muskrat body in
blue dungarees.  He carried Millie's head under his arm like a football
helmet.  I heard a click from inside the costume, and Millie's chest
popped open, hinged at the waist, like the hood of a Volkswagen Bug.
Trevor's white t-shirt clung to his body in large dark splotches.  He
slid his arms out of Millie's, and placed the animal's head on the
floor.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;How you doing, Trev?&quot; I asked.  Unsmiling, he nodded and grabbed a
pack of cigarettes and a lighter from his shirt hung on the back of a
chair.  I sat down again as he lit a cigarette and took a long drag,
most of Millie's body now crumpled down around his knees.  He pointed
the pack at me and raised his right eyebrow in offering.  &quot;No thanks,&quot;
I said.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He stepped the rest of the way out of Millie and sat down in his
director's chair facing the mirror.  He stared at himself for a few
seconds and then turned to me.  &quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; he said.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor looked bad, worse than usual.  His lifestyle must have been
wearing on his health.  Some mornings he would have bouts, as a result
of the smoking, I assumed, of deep, wrenching coughs.  Four or five
times, after he came home from work, or late at night, I heard him
heaving in the bathroom, his stomach and lungs convulsing to expel its
own sickness.  Twice I had asked him about it.  He had halfheartedly
dismissed my concern, &quot;Oh, just the flu.  You know, from all those
kids.&quot;  When I asked him again, a few weeks later, he had been more
open.  In a daze he had described to me the pain he felt daily.  &quot;The
nearest I can come to describing the sensation,&quot; he once told me, &quot;is
like a pitting in the stomach that spreads to the chest, and through
the veins to the extremities.  A pitting, a rotting that falls on me in
waves so that at times I think I will pass out.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor now inspected the galaxy of freckles on his shoulders and back.
He had fair skin, and several severe sun burns had mottled the upper
half of his torso with brown spots.  His two muscleless pectorals
flanked a hollow at the base of his sternum, a harmless physical
irregularity that embarrassed him in front of most.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He looked at himself in the mirror again.  &quot;All it takes is one hit,&quot;
he said picking at a raised mole on his shoulder.  &quot;One single photon
to a single cell, to several cells, a melanoma, to your nervous system,
to your brain.  But all you see is that one harmless looking dot while
underneath it is a network of cancer.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">A dwarf dressed like a rabbit in a smoking jacket stepped into the
doorway. </font>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Trevor, what time you go back up?&quot; the dwarf asked.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Five minutes, Santi,&quot; said Trevor.
</font>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Hokay,&quot; said the dwarf and scurried off.  Trevor explained, &quot;That's
Santiago, he plays the smaller full suits in the park.  He likes to
make sure he can walk around with the larger characters. Sometimes
teenage kids fuck with him, you know, kick him around. You would be
surprised how many adults assault the park characters.&quot;  Trevor turned
to show me a bruise on his side.  &quot;Some geezer socked me just to
impress his grandkids.  Its like even the adults don't know the
difference between what they see in the park and what they see on TV,
if there is any difference.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;You have to put up with all that?&quot; I asked.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor shrugged, &quot;A big guy that works here 
used to be a professional
hockey player threw off his mask and beat the shit out of a fifteen
year old kid for stepping on his foot.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Trevor paused and stared at the floor.  &quot;Trevor, what's the matter, why
did you call me?&quot;  I tried not to express too much concern so as not to
scare him off.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He turned again to the mirror and coughed forcefully.  &quot;You know, Nazi
war criminals,&quot; Trevor continued, &quot;exonerated themselves by attributing
their acts to the institution of which they were a part.  What a relief
to do that, what a relief to feel that comfort, to have the faith that
your soul is pure despite your actions.&quot;  He stopped suddenly, looked
at his watch, and took a final drag on his cigarette before rubbing it
out on his linoleum counter-top.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why don't you take the rest of the day off, Trevor,&quot; I suggested.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">This only seemed to irritate him.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Look,&quot; he said.  &quot;I have to get back to work, but I just wanted you to
see where I work, that's all.  Here,&quot; he reached into a drawer
underneath his dresser, &quot;take these, take your nephews to the park some
weekend.  These are free passes.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He put the passes in my hand and stood up quickly.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Thanks, Trevor.  We can take the kids some weekend,&quot; I said. &quot;Maybe
you'd like my sister. She's divorced, you know.&quot; </font>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sure,&quot; he said, &quot;That would be great.&quot;</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Without either of us saying goodbye, he stepped back into Millie,
zipped himself up and left.  I stayed in the chair staring at the
tickets for some time. </font>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">Santiago the dwarf shuffled by in the hall yelling &quot;fuck you's&quot; at the
cat who had given me directions on the way in.</font><p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">He glanced at me, paused when he saw Trevor was not in the room,
hesitated, and said, &quot;Mufuck goin' to keel himself.  Crazy bastard.
Trevor works too hard.  All upset cause yesserday Millie scare some
creeple kid into seizure.  Funniest theen I ever seen. We all joke him
about it, but he don't theenk its funny.&quot; </font>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">I made my way back through the network of dark hallways and surfaced
near where I had parked.  A large green frog with a top hat was
pretending to direct traffic in front of the park entrance. I walked
over to the frog and knocked him down, grateful that I would feel
guilty for it later.</font><p align="justify">
