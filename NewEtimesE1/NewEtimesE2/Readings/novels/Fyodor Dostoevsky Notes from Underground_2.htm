    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">I</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">At that time I was only twenty-four. My life was even then gloomy, 
    ill-regulated, and as solitary as that of a savage. I made friends with no 
    one and positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more in my 
    hole. At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and was perfectly well 
    aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a queer fellow, but 
    even looked upon me每I always fancied this每with a sort of loathing. I 
    sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me fancied that he was 
    looked upon with aversion? One of the clerks had a most repulsive, 
    pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous. I believe I should not 
    have dared to look at anyone with such an unsightly countenance. Another had 
    such a very dirty old uniform that there was an unpleasant odour in his 
    proximity. Yet not one of these gentlemen showed the slightest 
    self-consciousness每either about their clothes or their countenance or their 
    character in any way. Neither of them ever imagined that they were looked at 
    with repulsion; if they had imagined it they would not have minded每so long 
    as their superiors did not look at them in that way. It is clear to me now 
    that, owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for 
    myself, I often looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on 
    loathing, and so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone. I hated 
    my face, for instance: I thought it disgusting, and even suspected that 
    there was something base in my expression, and so every day when I turned up 
    at the office I tried to behave as independently as possible, and to assume 
    a lofty expression, so that I might not be suspected of being abject. "My 
    face may be ugly," I thought, "but let it be lofty, expressive, and, above 
    all, <I>extremely</I> intelligent." But I was positively and painfully 
    certain that it was impossible for my countenance ever to express those 
    qualities. And what was worst of all, I thought it actually stupid looking, 
    and I would have been quite satisfied if I could have looked intelligent. In 
    fact, I would even have put up with looking base if, at the same time, my 
    face could have been thought strikingly intelligent.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them all, 
    yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact, it happened 
    at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself. It somehow 
    happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and 
    thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain 
    without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising 
    and almost hating himself at certain moments. But whether I despised them or 
    thought them superior I dropped my eyes almost every time I met anyone. I 
    even made experiments whether I could face so and so's looking at me, and I 
    was always the first to drop my eyes. This worried me to distraction. I had 
    a sickly dread, too, of being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for 
    the conventional in everything external. I loved to fall into the common 
    rut, and had a whole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. 
    But how could I live up to it? I was morbidly sensitive as a man of our age 
    should be. They were all stupid, and as like one another as so many sheep. 
    Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was a coward and 
    a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly developed. But it 
    was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. I was a coward and a 
    slave. I say this without the slightest embarrassment. Every decent man of 
    our age must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. Of that 
    I am firmly persuaded. He is made and constructed to that very end. And not 
    only at the present time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at 
    all times, a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law 
    of nature for all decent people all over the earth. If anyone of them 
    happens to be valiant about something, he need not be comforted nor carried 
    away by that; he would show the white feather just the same before something 
    else. That is how it invariably and inevitably ends. Only donkeys and mules 
    are valiant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall. It is not 
    worth while to pay attention to them for they really are of no 
    consequence.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Another circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no 
    one like me and I was unlike anyone else. "I am alone and they are 
    <I>everyone,</I>" I thought每and pondered.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">From that it is evident that I was still a youngster.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The very opposite sometimes happened. It was loathsome sometimes to go to 
    the office; things reached such a point that I often came home ill. But all 
    at once, a propos of nothing, there would come a phase of scepticism and 
    indifference (everything happened in phases to me), and I would laugh myself 
    at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would reproach myself with being 
    <I>romantic</I>. At one time I was unwilling to speak to anyone, while at 
    other times I would not only talk, but go to the length of contemplating 
    making friends with them. All my fastidiousness would suddenly, for no rhyme 
    or reason, vanish. Who knows, perhaps I never had really had it, and it had 
    simply been affected, and got out of books. I have not decided that question 
    even now. Once I quite made friends with them, visited their homes, played 
    preference, drank vodka, talked of promotions.... But here let me make a 
    digression.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">We Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish 
    transcendental "romantics"每German, and still more French每on whom nothing 
    produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France perished at 
    the barricades, they would still be the same, they would not even have the 
    decency to affect a change, but would still go on singing their 
    transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because they are fools. We, 
    in Russia, have no fools; that is well known. That is what distinguishes us 
    from foreign lands. Consequently these transcendental natures are not found 
    amongst us in their pure form. The idea that they are is due to our 
    "realistic" journalists and critics of that day, always on the look out for 
    Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our 
    ideal; they have slandered our romantics, taking them for the same 
    transcendental sort as in Germany or France. On the contrary, the 
    characteristics of our "romantics" are absolutely and directly opposed to 
    the transcendental European type, and no European standard can be applied to 
    them. (Allow me to make use of this word "romantic"-an old-fashioned and 
    much respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all.) The 
    characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, <I>to see 
    everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly than our most 
    realistic minds see it;</I> to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at 
    the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from policy; 
    never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as rent-free quarters 
    at the government expense, pensions, decorations), to keep their eye on that 
    object through all the enthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and at the 
    same time to preserve "the sublime and the beautiful" inviolate within them 
    to the hour of their death, and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, 
    like some precious jewel wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of 
    "the sublime and the beautiful." Our "romantic" is a man of great breadth 
    and the greatest rogue of all our rogues, I assure you.... I can assure you 
    from experience, indeed. Of course, that is, if he is intelligent. But what 
    am I saying! The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to observe 
    that although we have had foolish romantics they don't count, and they were 
    only so because in the flower of their youth they degenerated into Germans, 
    and to preserve their precious jewel more comfortably, settled somewhere out 
    there每by preference in Weimar or the Black Forest. I, for instance, 
    genuinely despised my official work and did not openly abuse it simply 
    because I was in it myself and got a salary for it. Anyway, take note, I did 
    not openly abuse it. Our romantic would rather go out of his mind每a thing, 
    however, which very rarely happens每than take to open abuse, unless he had 
    some other career in view; and he is never kicked out. At most, they would 
    take him to the lunatic asylum as "the King of Spain" if he should go very 
    mad. But it is only the thin, fair people who go out of their minds in 
    Russia. Innumerable "romantics" attain later in life to considerable rank in 
    the service. Their many-sidedness is remarkable! And what a faculty they 
    have for the most contradictory sensations! I was comforted by this thought 
    even in those days, and I am of the same opinion now. That is why there are 
    so many "broad natures" among us who never lose their ideal even in the 
    depths of degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their ideal, 
    though they are arrant thieves and knaves, yet they tearfully cherish their 
    first ideal and are extraordinarily honest at heart. Yes, it is only among 
    us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely and loftily honest at 
    heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue. I repeat, our romantics, 
    frequently, become such accomplished rascals (I use the term "rascals" 
    affectionately), suddenly display such a sense of reality and practical 
    knowledge that their bewildered superiors and the public generally can only 
    ejaculate in amazement.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Their many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it may 
    develop into later on, and what the future has in store for us. It is not a 
    poor material! I do not say this from any foolish or boastful patriotism. 
    But I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am joking. Or perhaps 
    it's just the contrary and you are convinced that I really think so. Anyway, 
    gentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an honour and a special favour. And 
    do forgive my digression.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and 
    soon was at loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I even 
    gave up bowing to them, as though I had cut off all relations. That, 
    however, only happened to me once. As a rule, I was always alone.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">In the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading. I tried to 
    stifle all that was continually seething within me by means of external 
    impressions. And the only external means I had was reading. Reading, of 
    course, was a great help每exciting me, giving me pleasure and pain. But at 
    times it bored me fearfully. One longed for movement in spite of everything, 
    and I plunged all at once into dark, underground, loathsome vice of the 
    pettiest kind. My wretched passions were acute, smarting, from my continual, 
    sickly irritability I had hysterical impulses, with tears and convulsions. I 
    had no resource except reading, that is, there was nothing in my 
    surroundings which I could respect and which attracted me. I was overwhelmed 
    with depression, too; I had an hysterical craving for incongruity and for 
    contrast, and so I took to vice. I have not said all this to justify 
    myself.... But, no! I am lying. I did want to justify myself. I make that 
    little observation for my own benefit, gentlemen. I don't want to lie. I 
    vowed to myself I would not.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy 
    vice, with a feeling of shame which never deserted me, even at the most 
    loathsome moments, and which at such moments nearly made me curse. Already 
    even then I had my underground world in my soul. I was fearfully afraid of 
    being seen, of being met, of being recognised. I visited various obscure 
    haunts.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">One night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window some 
    gentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown out of the 
    window. At other times I should have felt very much disgusted, but I was in 
    such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the gentleman thrown out of 
    the window每and I envied him so much that I even went into the tavern and 
    into the billiard-room. "Perhaps," I thought, "I'll have a fight, too, and 
    they'll throw me out of the window." </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was not drunk每but what is one to do每depression will drive a man to such 
    a pitch of hysteria! But nothing happened. It seemed that I was not even 
    equal to being thrown out of the window and I went away without having my 
    fight.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">An officer put me in my place from the first moment.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up the 
    way, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without a 
    word每without a warning or explanation每moved me from where I was standing to 
    another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me. I could have 
    forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved me without noticing 
    me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Devil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel每a more 
    decent, a more <I>literary</I> one, so to speak. I had been treated like a 
    fly. This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little fellow. 
    But the quarrel was in my hands. I had only to protest and I certainly would 
    have been thrown out of the window. But I changed my mind and preferred to 
    beat a resentful retreat.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the 
    next night I went out again with the same lewd intentions, still more 
    furtively, abjectly and miserably than before, as it were, with tears in my 
    eyes每but still I did go out again. Don't imagine, though, it was cowardice 
    made me slink away from the officer; I never have been a coward at heart, 
    though I have always been a coward in action. Don't be in a hurry to laugh每I 
    assure you I can explain it all.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Oh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to 
    fight a duel! But no, he was one of those gentlemen (alas, long extinct!) 
    who preferred fighting with cues or, like Gogol's Lieutenant Pirogov, 
    appealing to the police. They did not fight duels and would have thought a 
    duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly procedure in any case每and 
    they looked upon the duel altogether as something impossible, something 
    free-thinking and French. But they were quite ready to bully, especially 
    when they were over six foot.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded vanity. 
    I was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound thrashing and being 
    thrown out of the window; I should have had physical courage enough, I 
    assure you; but I had not the moral courage. What I was afraid of was that 
    everyone present, from the insolent marker down to the lowest little 
    stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy collar, would jeer at me and fail to 
    understand when I began to protest and to address them in literary language. 
    For of the point of honour每not of honour, but of the point of honour (point 
    d'honneur)每one cannot speak among us except in literary language. You can't 
    allude to the "point of honour" in ordinary language. I was fully convinced 
    (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!) that they would all 
    simply split their sides with laughter, and that the officer would not 
    simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but would certainly prod me 
    in the back with his knee, kick me round the billiard- table, and only then 
    perhaps have pity and drop me out of the window. Of course, this trivial 
    incident could not with me end in that. I often met that officer afterwards 
    in the street and noticed him very carefully. I am not quite sure whether he 
    recognised me, I imagine not; I judge from certain signs. But I每I stared at 
    him with spite and hatred and so it went on ... for several years! My 
    resentment grew even deeper with years. At first I began making stealthy 
    inquiries about this officer. It was difficult for me to do so, for I knew 
    no one. But one day I heard someone shout his surname in the street as I was 
    following him at a distance, as though I were tied to him每and so I learnt 
    his surname. Another time I followed him to his flat, and for ten kopecks 
    learned from the porter where he lived, on which storey, whether he lived 
    alone or with others, and so on每in fact, everything one could learn from a 
    porter. One morning, though I had never tried my hand with the pen, it 
    suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer in the form of a 
    novel which would unmask his villainy. I wrote the novel with relish. I did 
    unmask his villainy, I even exaggerated it; at first I so altered his 
    surname that it could easily be recognised, but on second thoughts I changed 
    it, and sent the story to the Otetchestvenniya Zapiski. But at that time 
    such attacks were not the fashion and my story was not printed. That was a 
    great vexation to me. Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment. At 
    last I determined to challenge my enemy to a duel. I composed a splendid, 
    charming letter to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting rather 
    plainly at a duel in case of refusal. The letter was so composed that if the 
    officer had had the least understanding of the sublime and the beautiful he 
    would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have offered me his 
    friendship. And how fine that would have been! How we should have got on 
    together! He could have shielded me with his higher rank, while I could have 
    improved his mind with my culture, and, well ... my ideas, and all sorts of 
    things might have happened. Only fancy, this was two years after his insult 
    to me, and my challenge would have been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite 
    of all the ingenuity of my letter in disguising and explaining away the 
    anachronism. But, thank God (to this day I thank the Almighty with tears in 
    my eyes) I did not send the letter to him. Cold shivers run down my back 
    when I think of what might have happened if I had sent it. And all at once I 
    revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of genius! A brilliant 
    thought suddenly dawned upon me. Sometimes on holidays I used to stroll 
    along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four o'clock in the afternoon. 
    Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a series of innumerable miseries, 
    humiliations and resentments; but no doubt that was just what I wanted. I 
    used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion, like an eel, continually 
    moving aside to make way for generals, for officers of the guards and the 
    hussars, or for ladies. At such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge 
    at my heart, and I used to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of 
    the wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my 
    little scurrying figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a continual, 
    intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant and 
    direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this world, a 
    nasty, disgusting fly每more intelligent, more highly developed, more refined 
    in feeling than any of them, of course每but a fly that was continually making 
    way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone. Why I inflicted this 
    torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I don't know. I felt simply 
    drawn there at every possible opportunity.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I 
    spoke in the first chapter. After my affair with the officer I felt even 
    more drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him most 
    frequently, there I could admire him. He, too, went there chiefly on 
    holidays, He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of high 
    rank, and he too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people, like me, or 
    even better dressed than me, he simply walked over; he made straight for 
    them as though there was nothing but empty space before him, and never, 
    under any circumstances, turned aside. I gloated over my resentment watching 
    him and ... always resentfully made way for him. It exasperated me that even 
    in the street I could not be on an even footing with him.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?" I kept asking 
    myself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o'clock in the 
    morning. "Why is it you and not he? There's no regulation about it; there's 
    no written law. Let the making way be equal as it usually is when refined 
    people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass with mutual 
    respect."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not even 
    notice my making way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea dawned upon 
    me! "What," I thought, "if I meet him and don't move on one side? What if I 
    don't move aside on purpose, even if I knock up against him? How would that 
    be?" This audacious idea took such a hold on me that it gave me no peace. I 
    was dreaming of it continually, horribly, and I purposely went more 
    frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture more vividly how I should do it 
    when I did do it. I was delighted. This intention seemed to me more and more 
    practical and possible.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Of course I shall not really push him," I thought, already more 
    good-natured in my joy. "I will simply not turn aside, will run up against 
    him, not very violently, but just shouldering each other每just as much as 
    decency permits. I will push against him just as much as he pushes against 
    me." At last I made up my mind completely. But my preparations took a great 
    deal of time. To begin with, when I carried out my plan I should need to be 
    looking rather more decent, and so I had to think of my get-up. "In case of 
    emergency, if, for instance, there were any sort of public scandal (and the 
    public there is of the most recherche: the Countess walks there; Prince D. 
    walks there; all the literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that 
    inspires respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of 
    the society."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought at 
    Tchurkin's a pair of black gloves and a decent hat. Black gloves seemed to 
    me both more dignified and bon ton than the lemon-coloured ones which I had 
    contemplated at first. "The colour is too gaudy, it looks as though one were 
    trying to be conspicuous," and I did not take the lemon-coloured ones. I had 
    got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs; my overcoat 
    was the only thing that held me back. The coat in itself was a very good 
    one, it kept me warm; but it was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which 
    was the height of vulgarity. I had to change the collar at any sacrifice, 
    and to have a beaver one like an officer's. For this purpose I began 
    visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece 
    of cheap German beaver. Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and 
    look wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I only needed it 
    for the occasion. I asked the price; even so, it was too expensive. After 
    thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar. The rest of 
    the money每a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow from Anton 
    Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming person, though 
    grave and judicious. He never lent money to anyone, but I had, on entering 
    the service, been specially recommended to him by an important personage who 
    had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To borrow from Anton Antonitch 
    seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did not sleep for two or three 
    nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that time, I was in a fever; I had a 
    vague sinking at my heart or else a sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing! 
    Anton Antonitch was surprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, 
    and did after all lend me the money, receiving from me a written 
    authorisation to take from my salary a fortnight later the sum that he had 
    lent me. In this way everything was at last ready. The handsome beaver 
    replaced the mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work. It 
    would never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be carried 
    out skilfully, by degrees. But I must confess that after many efforts I 
    began to despair: we simply could not run into each other. I made every 
    preparation, I was quite determined每it seemed as though we should run into 
    one another directly每and before I knew what I was doing I had stepped aside 
    for him again and he had passed without noticing me. I even prayed as I 
    approached him that God would grant me determination. One time I had made up 
    my mind thoroughly, but it ended in my stumbling and falling at his feet 
    because at the very last instant when I was six inches from him my courage 
    failed me. He very calmly stepped over me, while I flew on one side like a 
    ball. That night I was ill again, feverish and delirious. And suddenly it 
    ended most happily. The night before I had made up my mind not to carry out 
    my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with that object I went to the 
    Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I would abandon it all. Suddenly, 
    three paces from my enemy, I unexpectedly made up my mind每I closed my eyes, 
    and we ran full tilt, shoulder to shoulder, against one another! I did not 
    budge an inch and passed him on a perfectly equal footing! He did not even 
    look round and pretended not to notice it; but he was only pretending, I am 
    convinced of that. I am convinced of that to this day! Of course, I got the 
    worst of it每he was stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that 
    I had attained my object, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a 
    step, and had put myself publicly on an equal social footing with him. I 
    returned home feeling that I was fully avenged for everything. I was 
    delighted. I was triumphant and sang Italian arias. Of course, I will not 
    describe to you what happened to me three days later; if you have read my 
    first chapter you can guess for yourself. The officer was afterwards 
    transferred; I have not seen him now for fourteen years. What is the dear 
    fellow doing now? Whom is he walking over?</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">II</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick 
    afterwards. It was followed by remorse每I tried to drive it away; I felt too 
    sick. By degrees, however, I grew used to that too. I grew used to 
    everything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it. But I 
    had a means of escape that reconciled everything每that was to find refuge in 
    "the sublime and the beautiful," in dreams, of course. I was a terrible 
    dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away in my corner, 
    and you may believe me that at those moments I had no resemblance to the 
    gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken heart, put a collar of 
    German beaver on his great-coat. I suddenly became a hero. I would not have 
    admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if he had called on me. I could not 
    even picture him before me then. What were my dreams and how I could satisfy 
    myself with them每it is hard to say now, but at the time I was satisfied with 
    them. Though, indeed, even now, I am to some extent satisfied with them. 
    Dreams were particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they 
    came with remorse and with tears, with curses and transports. There were 
    moments of such positive intoxication, of such happiness, that there was not 
    the faintest trace of irony within me, on my honour. I had faith, hope, 
    love. I believed blindly at such times that by some miracle, by some 
    external circumstance, all this would suddenly open out, expand; that 
    suddenly a vista of suitable activity每beneficent, good, and, above all, 
    <I>ready made</I> (what sort of activity I had no idea, but the great thing 
    was that it should be all ready for me)每would rise up before me每and I should 
    come out into the light of day, almost riding a white horse and crowned with 
    laurel. Anything but the foremost place I could not conceive for myself, and 
    for that very reason I quite contentedly occupied the lowest in reality. 
    Either to be a hero or to grovel in the mud每there was nothing between. That 
    was my ruin, for when I was in the mud I comforted myself with the thought 
    that at other times I was a hero, and the hero was a cloak for the mud: for 
    an ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a hero was too lofty 
    to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself. It is worth noting 
    that these attacks of the "sublime and the beautiful" visited me even during 
    the period of dissipation and just at the times when I was touching the 
    bottom. They came in separate spurts, as though reminding me of themselves, 
    but did not banish the dissipation by their appearance. On the contrary, 
    they seemed to add a zest to it by contrast, and were only sufficiently 
    present to serve as an appetising sauce. That sauce was made up of 
    contradictions and sufferings, of agonising inward analysis, and all these 
    pangs and pin-pricks gave a certain piquancy, even a significance to my 
    dissipation每in fact, completely answered the purpose of an appetising sauce. 
    There was a certain depth of meaning in it. And I could hardly have resigned 
    myself to the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured 
    all the filthiness of it. What could have allured me about it then and have 
    drawn me at night into the street? No, I had a lofty way of getting out of 
    it all.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times 
    in those dreams of mine! in those "flights into the sublime and the 
    beautiful"; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied to 
    anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that one did 
    not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality; that would have 
    been superfluous. Everything, however, passed satisfactorily by a lazy and 
    fascinating transition into the sphere of art, that is, into the beautiful 
    forms of life, lying ready, largely stolen from the poets and novelists and 
    adapted to all sorts of needs and uses. I, for instance, was triumphant over 
    everyone; everyone, of course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced 
    spontaneously to recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all. I was a 
    poet and a grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions 
    and immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed 
    before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not merely 
    shameful, but had in them much that was "sublime and beautiful" something in 
    the Manfred style. Everyone would kiss me and weep (what idiots they would 
    be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and hungry preaching new 
    ideas and fighting a victorious Austerlitz against the obscurantists. Then 
    the band would play a march, an amnesty would be declared, the Pope would 
    agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then there would be a ball for the 
    whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como 
    being for that purpose transferred to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would 
    come a scene in the bushes, and so on, and so on每as though you did not know 
    all about it? You will say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all 
    this into public after all the tears and transports which I have myself 
    confessed. But why is it contemptible? Can you imagine that I am ashamed of 
    it all, and that it was stupider than anything in your life, gentlemen? And 
    I can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly 
    composed.... It did not all happen on the shores of Lake Como. And yet you 
    are right每it really is vulgar and contemptible. And most contemptible of all 
    it is that now I am attempting to justify myself to you. And even more 
    contemptible than that is my making this remark now. But that's enough, or 
    there will be no end to it; each step will be more contemptible than the 
    last....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time without 
    feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society. To plunge into 
    society meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton Antonitch 
    Syetotchkin. He was the only permanent acquaintance I have had in my life, 
    and I wonder at the fact myself now. But I only went to see him when that 
    phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached such a point of bliss 
    that it became essential at once to embrace my fellows and all mankind; and 
    for that purpose I needed, at least, one human being, actually existing. I 
    had to call on Anton Antonitch, however, on Tuesday每his at-home day; so I 
    had always to time my passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might 
    fall on a Tuesday.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">This Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five 
    Corners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a 
    particularly frugal and sallow appearance. He had two daughters and their 
    aunt, who used to pour out the tea. Of the daughters one was thirteen and 
    another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was awfully shy of them 
    because they were always whispering and giggling together. The master of the 
    house usually sat in his study on a leather couch in front of the table with 
    some grey-headed gentleman, usually a colleague from our office or some 
    other department. I never saw more than two or three visitors there, always 
    the same. They talked about the excise duty; about business in the senate, 
    about salaries, about promotions, about His Excellency, and the best means 
    of pleasing him, and so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside 
    these people for four hours at a stretch, listening to them without knowing 
    what to say to them or venturing to say a word. I became stupefied, several 
    times I felt myself perspiring, I was overcome by a sort of paralysis; but 
    this was pleasant and good for me. On returning home I deferred for a time 
    my desire to embrace all mankind.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an old 
    schoolfellow. I had a number of schoolfellows, indeed, in Petersburg, but I 
    did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them in the 
    street. I believe I had transferred into the department I was in simply to 
    avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my hateful childhood. 
    Curses on that school and all those terrible years of penal servitude! In 
    short, I parted from my schoolfellows as soon as I got out into the world. 
    There were two or three left to whom I nodded in the street. One of them was 
    Simonov, who had in no way been distinguished at school, was of a quiet and 
    equable disposition; but I discovered in him a certain independence of 
    character and even honesty. I don't even suppose that he was particularly 
    stupid. I had at one time spent some rather soulful moments with him, but 
    these had not lasted long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over. He was 
    evidently uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always 
    afraid that I might take up the same tone again. I suspected that he had an 
    aversion for me, but still I went on going to see him, not being quite 
    certain of it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that as 
    it was Thursday Anton Antonitch's door would be closed, I thought of 
    Simonov. Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that the man 
    disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him. But as it always 
    happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely, to put 
    myself into a false position, I went in. It was almost a year since I had 
    last seen Simonov.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">III</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I found two of my old schoolfellows with him. They seemed to be 
    discussing an important matter. All of them took scarcely any notice of my 
    entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years. Evidently 
    they looked upon me as something on the level of a common fly. I had not 
    been treated like that even at school, though they all hated me. I knew, of 
    course, that they must despise me now for my lack of success in the service, 
    and for my having let myself sink so low, going about badly dressed and so 
    on每which seemed to them a sign of my incapacity and insignificance. But I 
    had not expected such contempt. Simonov was positively surprised at my 
    turning up. Even in old days he had always seemed surprised at my coming. 
    All this disconcerted me: I sat down, feeling rather miserable, and began 
    listening to what they were saying.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell 
    dinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of theirs 
    called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a distant 
    province. This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me too. I had 
    begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms. In the lower forms he had 
    simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody liked. I had hated him, 
    however, even in the lower forms, just because he was a pretty and playful 
    boy. He was always bad at his lessons and got worse and worse as he went on; 
    however, he left with a good certificate, as he had powerful interests. 
    During his last year at school he came in for an estate of two hundred 
    serfs, and as almost all of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among 
    us. He was vulgar in the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured 
    fellow, even in his swaggering. In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham 
    notions of honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled 
    before Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered. And it was not from 
    any interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been 
    favoured by the gifts of nature. Moreover, it was, as it were, an accepted 
    idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact and the social 
    graces. This last fact particularly infuriated me. I hated the abrupt 
    self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of his own witticisms, 
    which were often frightfully stupid, though he was bold in his language; I 
    hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which I would, however, have gladly 
    exchanged my intelligent one), and the free-and-easy military manners in 
    fashion in the "'forties." I hated the way in which he used to talk of his 
    future conquests of women (he did not venture to begin his attack upon women 
    until he had the epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them 
    with impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting. 
    I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov, 
    when one day talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his 
    future relations with the fair sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in 
    the sun, he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village 
    girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his droit de seigneur, and that 
    if the peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and double 
    the tax on them, the bearded rascals. Our servile rabble applauded, but I 
    attacked him, not from compassion for the girls and their fathers, but 
    simply because they were applauding such an insect. I got the better of him 
    on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, 
    and so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really 
    complete; the laugh was on his side. He got the better of me on several 
    occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually. I remained 
    angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him. When we left 
    school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for I was flattered, 
    but we soon parted and quite naturally. Afterwards I heard of his 
    barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life he was leading. 
    Then there came other rumours每of his successes in the service. By then he 
    had taken to cutting me in the street, and I suspected that he was afraid of 
    compromising himself by greeting a personage as insignificant as me. I saw 
    him once in the theatre, in the third tier of boxes. By then he was wearing 
    shoulder-straps. He was twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself 
    with the daughters of an ancient General. In three years he had gone off 
    considerably, though he was still rather handsome and adroit. One could see 
    that by the time he was thirty he would be corpulent. So it was to this 
    Zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his departure. 
    They had kept up with him for those three years, though privately they did 
    not consider themselves on an equal footing with him, I am convinced of 
    that.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Of Simonov's two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German 每a 
    little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always deriding 
    everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the lower forms每a 
    vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most sensitive feeling 
    of personal honour, though, of course, he was a wretched little coward at 
    heart. He was one of those worshippers of Zverkov who made up to the latter 
    from interested motives, and often borrowed money from him. Simonov's other 
    visitor, Trudolyubov, was a person in no way remarkable每a tall young fellow, 
    in the army, with a cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success 
    of every sort, and was only capable of thinking of promotion. He was some 
    sort of distant relation of Zverkov's, and this, foolish as it seems, gave 
    him a certain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence 
    whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was 
tolerable.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Well, with seven roubles each," said Trudolyubov, "twenty-one roubles 
    between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner. Zverkov, 
    of course, won't pay."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Of course not, since we are inviting him," Simonov decided.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Can you imagine," Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like 
    some insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General's decorations, "can 
    you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone? He will accept from 
    delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?" observed Trudolyubov, 
    taking notice only of the half dozen.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles, at 
    the Hotel de Paris at five o'clock tomorrow," Simonov, who had been asked to 
    make the arrangements, concluded finally.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"How twenty-one roubles?" I asked in some agitation, with a show of being 
    offended; "if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but twenty-eight 
    roubles."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly would 
    be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at once and 
    would look at me with respect.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Do you want to join, too?" Simonov observed, with no appearance of 
    pleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me. He knew me through and 
through.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why not? I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I must own 
    I feel hurt that you have left me out," I said, boiling over again.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And where were we to find you?" Ferfitchkin put in roughly.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You never were on good terms with Zverkov," Trudolyubov added, 
    frowning.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that," I 
    retorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had happened. 
    "Perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I have not always 
    been on good terms with him."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, there's no making you out...with these refinements," Trudolyubov 
    jeered.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"We'll put your name down," Simonov decided, addressing me. "Tomorrow at 
    five-o'clock at the Hotel de Paris."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What about the money?" Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating me 
    to Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"That will do," said Trudolyubov, getting up. "If he wants to come so 
    much, let him."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But it's a private thing, between us friends," Ferfitchkin said crossly, 
    as he, too, picked up his hat. "It's not an official gathering."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"We do not want at all, perhaps..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">They went away. Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went out, 
    Trudolyubov barely nodded. Simonov, with whom I was left tete-a-tete, was in 
    a state of vexation and perplexity, and looked at me queerly. He did not sit 
    down and did not ask me to.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"H'm ... yes ... tomorrow, then. Will you pay your subscription now? I 
    just ask so as to know," he muttered in embarrassment.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I flushed crimson, as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov 
    fifteen roubles for ages每which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I had 
    not paid it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came 
    here....I am very much vexed that I have forgotten ...."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"All right, all right, that doesn't matter. You can pay tomorrow after 
    the dinner. I simply wanted to know....Please don't..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">He broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed. As he walked he 
    began to stamp with his heels.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Am I keeping you?" I asked, after two minutes of silence.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh!" he said, starting, "that is每to be truthful每yes. I have to go and 
    see someone...not far from here," he added in an apologetic voice, somewhat 
    abashed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"My goodness, why didn't you say so?" I cried, seizing my cap, with an 
    astonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have 
    expected of myself</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It's close by...not two paces away," Simonov repeated, accompanying me 
    to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all. "So five 
    o'clock, punctually, tomorrow," he called down the stairs after me. He was 
    very glad to get rid of me. I was in a fury.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them?" I 
    wondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, "for a scoundrel, 
    a pig like that Zverkov! Of course I had better not go; of course, I must 
    just snap my fingers at them. I am not bound in any way. I'll send Simonov a 
    note by tomorrow's post...."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go, 
    that I should make a point of going; and the more tactless, the more 
    unseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money. All I had 
    was nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant, Apollon, for 
    his monthly wages. That was all I paid him每he had to keep himself.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Not to pay him was impossible, considering his character. But I will talk 
    about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">However, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">That night I had the most hideous dreams. No wonder; all the evening I 
    had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I could 
    not shake them off. I was sent to the school by distant relations, upon whom 
    I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing since每they sent me there a 
    forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their reproaches, already troubled 
    by doubt, and looking with savage distrust at everyone. My schoolfellows met 
    me with spiteful and merciless jibes because I was not like any of them. But 
    I could not endure their taunts; I could not give in to them with the 
    ignoble readiness with which they gave in to one another. I hated them from 
    the first, and shut myself away from everyone in timid, wounded and 
    disproportionate pride. Their coarseness revolted me. They laughed cynically 
    at my face, at my clumsy figure; and yet what stupid faces they had 
    themselves. In our school the boys' faces seemed in a special way to 
    degenerate and grow stupider. How many fine-looking boys came to us! In a 
    few years they became repulsive. Even at sixteen I wondered at them 
    morosely; even then I was struck by the pettiness of their thoughts, the 
    stupidity of their pursuits, their games, their conversations. They had no 
    understanding of such essential things, they took no interest in such 
    striking, impressive subjects, that I could not help considering them 
    inferior to myself. It was not wounded vanity that drove me to it, and for 
    God's sake do not thrust upon me your hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, 
    that "I was only a dreamer," while they even then had an understanding of 
    life. They understood nothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear 
    that that was what made me most indignant with them. On the contrary, the 
    most obvious, striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and 
    even at that time were accustomed to respect success. Everything that was 
    just, but oppressed and looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and 
    shamefully. They took rank for intelligence; even at sixteen they were 
    already talking about a snug berth. Of course, a great deal of it was due to 
    their stupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always been 
    surrounded in their childhood and boyhood. They were monstrously depraved. 
    Of course a great deal of that, too, was superficial and an assumption of 
    cynicism; of course there were glimpses of youth and freshness even in their 
    depravity; but even that freshness was not attractive, and showed itself in 
    a certain rakishness. I hated them horribly, though perhaps I was worse than 
    any of them. They repaid me in the same way, and did not conceal their 
    aversion for me. But by then I did not desire their affection: on the 
    contrary, I continually longed for their humiliation. To escape from their 
    derision I purposely began to make all the progress I could with my studies 
    and forced my way to the very top. This impressed them. Moreover, they all 
    began by degrees to grasp that I had already read books none of them could 
    read, and understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of 
    which they had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of it, 
    but were morally impressed, especially as the teachers began to notice me on 
    those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained, and cold and 
    strained relations became permanent between us. In the end I could not put 
    up with it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in me. 
    I attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows; but 
    somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and soon ended of 
    itself. Once, indeed, I did have a friend. But I was already a tyrant at 
    heart; I wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him; I tried to instil into 
    him a contempt for his surroundings; I required of him a disdainful and 
    complete break with those surroundings. I frightened him with my passionate 
    affection; I reduced him to tears, to hysterics. He was a simple and devoted 
    soul; but when he devoted himself to me entirely I began to hate him 
    immediately and repulsed him每as though all I needed him for was to win a 
    victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else. But I could not 
    subjugate all of them; my friend was not at all like them either, he was, in 
    fact, a rare exception. The first thing I did on leaving school was to give 
    up the special job for which I had been destined so as to break all ties, to 
    curse my past and shake the dust from off my feet.... And goodness knows 
    why, after all that, I should go trudging off to Simonov's!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with excitement, 
    as though it were all about to happen at once. But I believed that some 
    radical change in my life was coming, and would inevitably come that day. 
    Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external event, however trivial, always 
    made me feel as though some radical change in my life were at hand. I went 
    to the office, however, as usual, but sneaked away home two hours earlier to 
    get ready. The great thing, I thought, is not to be the first to arrive, or 
    they will think I am overjoyed at coming. But there were thousands of such 
    great points to consider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me. I 
    polished my boots a second time with my own hands; nothing in the world 
    would have induced Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that 
    it was more than his duties required of him. I stole the brushes to clean 
    them from the passage, being careful he should not detect it, for fear of 
    his contempt. Then I minutely examined my clothes and thought that 
    everything looked old, worn and threadbare. I had let myself get too 
    slovenly. My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could not go out to dinner in 
    my uniform. The worst of it was that on the knee of my trousers was a big 
    yellow stain. I had a foreboding that that stain would deprive me of 
    nine-tenths of my personal dignity. I knew, too, that it was very poor to 
    think so. "But this is no time for thinking: now I am in for the real 
    thing," I thought, and my heart sank. I knew, too, perfectly well even then, 
    that I was monstrously exaggerating the facts. But how could I help it? I 
    could not control myself and was already shaking with fever. With despair I 
    pictured to myself how coldly and disdainfully that "scoundrel" Zverkov 
    would meet me; with what dull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead 
    Trudolyubov would look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect 
    Ferfitchkin would snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how 
    completely Simonov would take it all in, and how he would despise me for the 
    abjectness of my vanity and lack of spirit每and, worst of all, how paltry, 
    <I>unliterary,</I> commonplace it would all be. Of course, the best thing 
    would be not to go at all. But that was most impossible of all: if I feel 
    impelled to do anything, I seem to be pitchforked into it. I should have 
    jeered at myself ever afterwards: "So you funked it, you funked it, you 
    funked the <I>real thing</I>!" On the contrary, I passionately longed to 
    show all that "rabble" that I was by no means such a spiritless creature as 
    I seemed to myself. What is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this 
    cowardly fever, I dreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, 
    carrying them away, making them like me每if only for my "elevation of thought 
    and unmistakable wit." They would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side, 
    silent and ashamed, while I should crush him. Then, perhaps, we would be 
    reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most bitter 
    and humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for 
    certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not really 
    want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not care a straw 
    really for the result, even if I did achieve it. Oh, how I prayed for the 
    day to pass quickly! In unutterable anguish I went to the window, opened the 
    movable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly 
    falling wet snow. At last my wretched little clock hissed out five. I seized 
    my hat and, trying not to look at Apollon, who had been all day expecting 
    his month's wages, but in his foolishness was unwilling to be the first to 
    speak about it, I slipped between him and the door and, lumping into a 
    high-class sledge, on which I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand 
    style to the Hotel de Paris.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">IV</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive. 
    But it was not a question of being the first to arrive. Not only were they 
    not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room. The table was not laid 
    even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited from the 
    waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o'clock. 
    This was confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really ashamed to go on 
    questioning them. It was only twenty-five minutes past five. If they changed 
    the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me know每that is what the 
    post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my own eyes 
    and...and even before the waiters. I sat down; the servant began laying the 
    table; I felt even more humiliated when he was present. Towards six o'clock 
    they brought in candles, though there were lamps burning in the room. It had 
    not occurred to the waiter, however, to bring them in at once when I 
    arrived. In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating 
    their dinners in silence at two different tables. There was a great deal of 
    noise, even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear the laughter of 
    a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at 
    the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely passed more unpleasant 
    moments, so much so that when they did arrive all together punctually at six 
    I was overjoyed to see them, as though they were my deliverers, and even 
    forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment. </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading 
    spirit. He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew 
    himself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather 
    jaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a friendly, but not 
    over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a 
    General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off something. I 
    had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would at once break into 
    his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and 
    witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever since the previous day, but I 
    had not expected such condescension, such high-official courtesy. So, then, 
    he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect! If he only meant 
    to insult me by that high-official tone, it would not matter, I thought每I 
    could pay him back for it one way or another. But what if, in reality, 
    without the least desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in 
    earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a 
    patronising way? The very supposition made me gasp.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us," he began, lisping 
    and drawling, which was something new. "You and I seem to have seen nothing 
    of one another. You shy away from us. You shouldn't. We are not such 
    terrible people as you think. Well, anyway, I am glad to renew our 
    acquaintance."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Have you been waiting long?" Trudolyubov inquired.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I arrived at five o'clock as you told me yesterday," I answered aloud, 
    with an irritability that threatened an explosion.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Didn't you let him know that we had changed the hour?" said Trudolyubov 
    to Simonov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No, I didn't. I forgot," the latter replied, with no sign of regret, and 
    without even apologising to me he went off to order the hors d'oeuvre.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"So you've been here a whole hour? Oh, poor fellow!" Zverkov cried 
    ironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny. That 
    rascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a puppy 
    yapping. My position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous and 
    embarrassing.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It isn't funny at all!" I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more irritated. 
    "It wasn't my fault, but other people's. They neglected to let me know. It 
    was...it was...it was simply absurd."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It's not only absurd, but something else as well," muttered Trudolyubov, 
    naively taking my part. "You are not hard enough upon it. It was simply 
    rudeness每unintentional, of course. And how could Simonov...h'm!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"If a trick like that had been played on me," observed Ferfitchkin, "I 
    should..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But you should have ordered something for yourself," Zverkov 
    interrupted, "or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You will allow that I might have done that without your permission," I 
    rapped out. "If I waited, it was..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Let us sit down, gentlemen," cried Simonov, coming in. "Everything is 
    ready; I can answer for the champagne; it is capitally frozen....You see, I 
    did not know your address, where was I to look for you?" he suddenly turned 
    to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me. Evidently he had 
    something against me. It must have been what happened yesterday.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">All sat down; I did the same. It was a round table. Trudolyubov was on my 
    left, Simonov on my right, Zverkov was sitting opposite, Ferfitchkin next to 
    him, between him and Trudolyubov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Tell me, are you...in a government office?" Zverkov went on attending to 
    me. Seeing that I was embarrassed he seriously thought that he ought to be 
    friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?" I thought, in a fury. In 
    my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated. </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"In the N每- office," I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And ha-ave you a go-od berth? I say, what ma-a-de you leave your 
    original job?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job," I drawled 
    more than he, hardly able to control myself. Ferfitchkin went off into a 
    guffaw. Simonov looked at me ironically. Trudolyubov left off eating and 
    began looking at me with curiosity.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Zverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And the remuneration?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What remuneration?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I mean, your sa-a-lary?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why are you cross-examining me?" However, I told him at once what my 
    salary was. I turned horribly red.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It is not very handsome," Zverkov observed majestically</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Yes, you can't afford to dine at cafes on that," Ferfitchkin added 
    insolently</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"To my thinking it's very poor," Trudolyubov observed gravely.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And how thin you have grown! How you have changed!" added Zverkov, with 
    a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire with a sort of 
    insolent compassion.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, spare his blushes," cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing," I broke out at 
    last; "do you hear? I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense, not 
    at other people's每note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Wha-at? Isn't every one here dining at his own expense? You would seem 
    to be ..." Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a lobster, and 
    looking me in the face with fury.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Tha-at," I answered, feeling I had gone too far, "and I imagine it would 
    be better to talk of something more intelligent."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Don't disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh? Have you gone out 
    of your wits in your office?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Enough, gentlemen, enough!" Zverkov cried, authoritatively.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"How stupid it is!" muttered Simonov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It really is stupid. We have met here, a company of friends, for a 
    farewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation," said 
    Trudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone. "You invited yourself to 
    join us, so don't disturb the general harmony."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Enough, enough!" cried Zverkov. "Give over, gentlemen, it's out of 
    place. Better let me tell you how I nearly got married the day before 
    yesterday ...."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had almost 
    been married two days before. There was not a word about the marriage, 
    however, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels and 
    kammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them. It was 
    greeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">No one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Good Heavens, these are not the people for me!" I thought. "And what a 
    fool I have made of myself before them! I let Ferfitchkin go too far, 
    though. The brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting me sit 
    down with them. They don't understand that it's an honour to them and not to 
    me! I've grown thinner! My clothes! Oh, damn my trousers! Zverkov noticed 
    the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in.... But what's the use! I 
    must get up at once, this very minute, take my hat and simply go without a 
    word...with contempt! And tomorrow I can send a challenge. The scoundrels! 
    As though I cared about the seven roubles. They may think.... Damn it! I 
    don't care about the seven roubles. I'll go this minute!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Of course I remained. I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my 
    discomfiture. Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected. My annoyance 
    increased as the wine went to my head. I longed all at once to insult them 
    all in a most flagrant manner and then go away. To seize the moment and show 
    what I could do, so that they would say, "He's clever, though he is absurd," 
    and...and...in fact, damn them all! </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes. But they seemed to 
    have forgotten me altogether. They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful. Zverkov 
    was talking all the time. I began listening. Zverkov was talking of some 
    exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring her love (of course, 
    he was lying like a horse), and how he had been helped in this affair by an 
    intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an officer in the hussars, who had 
    three thousand serfs.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an 
    appearance here tonight to see you off," I cut in suddenly. For one minute 
    every one was silent. </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You are drunk already." Trudolyubov deigned to notice me at last, 
    glancing contemptuously in my direction. Zverkov, without a word, examined 
    me as though I were an insect. I dropped my eyes. Simonov made haste to fill 
    up the glasses with champagne.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Trudolyubov raised his glass, as did everyone else but me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Your health and good luck on the journey!" he cried to Zverkov. "To old 
    times, to our future, hurrah!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">They all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss him. 
    I did not move; my full glass stood untouched before me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why, aren't you going to drink it?" roared Trudolyubov, losing patience 
    and turning menacingly to me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I want to make a speech separately, on my own account...and then I'll 
    drink it, Mr. Trudolyubov."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Spiteful brute!" muttered Simonov. I drew myself up in my chair and 
    feverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary, though I 
    did not know myself precisely what I was going to say.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"<I>Silence!</I>" cried Ferfitchkin. "Now for a display of wit!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Zverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Mr. Lieutenant Zverkov," I began, "let me tell you that I hate phrases, 
    phrasemongers and men in corsets...that's the first point, and there is a 
    second one to follow it."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">There was a general stir.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"The second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers. Especially 
    ribald talkers! The third point: I love justice, truth and honesty." I went 
    on almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with horror myself and 
    had no idea how I came to be talking like this. "I love thought, Monsieur 
    Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal footing and not...H'm...I love 
    ...But, however, why not? I will drink your health, too, Mr. Zverkov. Seduce 
    the Circassian girls, shoot the enemies of the fatherland and...and...to 
    your health, Monsieur Zverkov!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Zverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I am very much obliged to you." He was frightfully offended and turned 
    pale.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Damn the fellow!" roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on the 
    table.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Well, he wants a punch in the face for that," squealed Ferfitchkin.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"We ought to turn him out," muttered Simonov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Not a word, gentlemen, not a movement!" cried Zverkov solemnly, checking 
    the general indignation. "I thank you all, but I can show him for myself how 
    much value I attach to his words."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Mr. Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction tomorrow for your words 
    just now!" I said aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"A duel, you mean? Certainly," he answered. But probably I was so 
    ridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with my 
    appearance that everyone including Ferfitchkin was prostrate with 
    laughter.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Yes, let him alone, of course! He is quite drunk," Trudolyubov said with 
    disgust.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I shall never forgive myself for letting him join us," Simonov muttered 
    again.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads," I thought to myself. 
    I picked up the bottle...and filled my glass...."No, I'd better sit on to 
    the end," I went on thinking; "you would be pleased, my friends, if I went 
    away. Nothing will induce me to go. I'll go on sitting here and drinking to 
    the end, on purpose, as a sign that I don't think you of the slightest 
    consequence. I will go on sitting and drinking, because this is a 
    public-house and I paid my entrance money. I'll sit here and drink, for I 
    look upon you as so many pawns, as inanimate pawns. I'll sit here and 
    drink...and sing if I want to, yes, sing, for I have the right to...to 
    sing...H'm!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But I did not sing. I simply tried not to look at any of them. I assumed 
    most unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them to speak 
    <I>first</I>. But alas, they did not address me! And oh, how I wished, how I 
    wished at that moment to be reconciled to them! It struck eight, at last 
    nine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov stretched himself on a 
    lounge and put one foot on a round table. Wine was brought there. He did, as 
    a fact, order three bottles on his own account. I, of course, was not 
    invited to join them. They all sat round him on the sofa. They listened to 
    him, almost with reverence. It was evident that they were fond of him. "What 
    for? What for?" I wondered. From time to time they were moved to drunken 
    enthusiasm and kissed each other. They talked of the Caucasus, of the nature 
    of true passion, of snug berths in the service, of the income of an hussar 
    called Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew personally, and rejoiced in the 
    largeness of it, of the extraordinary grace and beauty of a Princess D., 
    whom none of them had ever seen; then it came to Shakespeare's being 
    immortal.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the 
    room, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again. I tried 
    my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet I 
    purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels. But it was all 
    in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up and down in 
    front of them from eight o'clock till eleven, in the same place, from the 
    table to the stove and back again. "I walk up and down to please myself and 
    no one can prevent me." The waiter who came into the room stopped, from time 
    to time, to look at me. I was somewhat giddy from turning round so often; at 
    moments it seemed to me that I was in delirium. During those three hours I 
    was three times soaked with sweat and dry again. At times, with an intense, 
    acute pang I was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty 
    years, forty years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember 
    with loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most 
    awful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to degrade 
    himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully, and yet I went on 
    pacing up and down from the table to the stove. "Oh, if you only knew what 
    thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured I am!" I thought at 
    moments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting. But 
    my enemies behaved as though I were not in the room. Once每only once每they 
    turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare, and I 
    suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. I laughed in such an affected and 
    disgusting way that they all at once broke off their conversation, and 
    silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and down from the 
    table to the stove, <I>taking no notice of them</I>. But nothing came of it: 
    they said nothing, and two minutes later they ceased to notice me again. It 
    struck eleven.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Friends," cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, "let us all be off 
    now, <I>there</I>!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Of course, of course," the others assented. I turned sharply to Zverkov. 
    I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my throat to put an 
    end to it. I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with perspiration, stuck to my 
    forehead and temples.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Zverkov, I beg your pardon," I said abruptly and resolutely. 
    "Ferfitchkin, yours too, and everyone's, everyone's: I have insulted you 
    all!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Aha! A duel is not in your line, old man," Ferfitchkin hissed 
    venomously.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It sent a sharp pang to my heart.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No, it's not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin! I am ready to fight 
    you tomorrow, after we are reconciled. I insist upon it, in fact, and you 
    cannot refuse. I want to show you that I am not afraid of a duel. You shall 
    fire first and I shall fire into the air."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"He is comforting himself," said Simonov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"He's simply raving," said Trudolyubov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But let us pass. Why are you barring our way? What do you want?" Zverkov 
    answered disdainfully</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">They were all flushed, their eyes were bright: they had been drinking 
    heavily.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Insulted? <I>You</I> insulted <I>me</I>? Understand, sir, that you 
    never, under any circumstances, could possibly insult <I>me</I>."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And that's enough for you. Out of the way!" concluded Trudolyubov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Olympia is mine, friends, that's agreed!" cried Zverkov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"We won't dispute your right, we won't dispute your right," the others 
    answered, laughing.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I stood as though spat upon. The party went noisily out of the room. 
    Trudolyubov struck up some stupid song. Simonov remained behind for a moment 
    to tip the waiters. I suddenly went up to him.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Simonov! give me six roubles!" I said, with desperate resolution.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">He looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes. He, too, was 
    drunk.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You don't mean you are coming with us?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Yes."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I've no money," he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went out of 
    the room.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I clutched at his overcoat. It was a nightmare.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Simonov, I saw you had money. Why do you refuse me? Am I a scoundrel? 
    Beware of refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am asking! My whole 
    future, my whole plans depend upon it!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Simonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Take it, if you have no sense of shame!" he pronounced pitilessly, and 
    ran to overtake them.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was left for a moment alone. Disorder, the remains of dinner, a broken 
    wine-glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of drink and 
    delirium in my brain, an agonising misery in my heart and finally the 
    waiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking inquisitively into my 
    face.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I am going there!" I cried. "Either they shall all go down on their 
    knees to beg for my friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the 
    face!"</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">V</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"So this is it, this is it at last每contact with real life," I muttered as 
    I ran headlong downstairs. "This is very different from the Pope's leaving 
    Rome and going to Brazil, very different from the ball on Lake Como!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You are a scoundrel," a thought flashed through my mind, "if you laugh 
    at this now."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No matter!" I cried, answering myself. "Now everything is lost!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">There was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference每I knew 
    where they had gone.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">At the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough 
    peasant coat, powdered over with the still falling, wet, and as it were 
    warm, snow. It was hot and steamy. The little shaggy piebald horse was also 
    covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well. I made a rush for 
    the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get into it, the 
    recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles seemed to double 
    me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a sack.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that," I cried. "But I 
    will make up for it or perish on the spot this very night. Start!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">We set off. There was a perfect whirl in my head.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"They won't go down on their knees to beg for my friendship. That is a 
    mirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical每that's another 
    ball on Lake Como. And so I am bound to slap Zverkov's face! It is my duty 
    to. And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap in the face. Hurry 
    up!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The driver tugged at the reins.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"As soon as I go in I'll give it him. Ought I before giving him the slap 
    to say a few words by way of preface? No. I'll simply go in and give it him. 
    They will all be sitting in the drawing-room, and he with Olympia on the 
    sofa. That damned Olympia! She laughed at my looks on one occasion and 
    refused me. I'll pull Olympia's hair, pull Zverkov's ears! No, better one 
    ear, and pull him by it round the room. Maybe they will all begin beating me 
    and will kick me out. That's most likely, indeed. No matter! Anyway, I shall 
    first slap him; the initiative will be mine; and by the laws of honour that 
    is everything: he will be branded and cannot wipe off the slap by any blows, 
    by nothing but a duel. He will be forced to fight. And let them beat me now. 
    Let them, the ungrateful wretches! Trudolyubov will beat me hardest, he is 
    so strong; Ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold sideways and tug at my 
    hair. But no matter, no matter! That's what I am going for. The blockheads 
    will be forced at last to see the tragedy of it all! When they drag me to 
    the door I shall call out to them that in reality they are not worth my 
    little finger. Get on, driver, get on!" I cried to the driver. He started 
    and flicked his whip, I shouted so savagely.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"We shall fight at daybreak, that's a settled thing. I've done with the 
    office. Ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now. But where can I get 
    pistols? Nonsense! I'll get my salary in advance and buy them. And powder, 
    and bullets? That's the second's business. And how can it all be done by 
    daybreak? and where am I to get a second? I have no friends. Nonsense!" I 
    cried, lashing myself up more and more. "It's of no consequence! the first 
    person I meet in the street is bound to be my second, just as he would be 
    bound to pull a drowning man out of water. The most eccentric things may 
    happen. Even if I were to ask the director himself to be my second tomorrow, 
    he would be bound to consent, if only from a feeling of chivalry, and to 
    keep the secret! Anton Antonitch...."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The fact is, that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my plan 
    and the other side of the question was clearer and more vivid to my 
    imagination than it could be to anyone on earth. But ....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Get on, driver, get on, you rascal, get on!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Ugh, sir!" said the son of toil.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Cold shivers suddenly ran down me. Wouldn't it be better...to go straight 
    home? My God, my God! Why did I invite myself to this dinner yesterday? But 
    no, it's impossible. And my walking up and down for three hours from the 
    table to the stove? No, they, they and no one else must pay for my walking 
    up and down! They must wipe out this dishonour! Drive on!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And what if they give me into custody? They won't dare! They'll be afraid 
    of the scandal. And what if Zverkov is so contemptuous that he refuses to 
    fight a duel? He is sure to; but in that case I'll show them...I will turn 
    up at the posting station when he's setting off tomorrow, I'll catch him by 
    the leg, I'll pull off his coat when he gets into the carriage. I'll get my 
    teeth into his hand, I'll bite him. "See what lengths you can drive a 
    desperate man to!" He may hit me on the head and they may belabour me from 
    behind. I will shout to the assembled multitude: "Look at this young puppy 
    who is driving off to captivate the Circassian girls after letting me spit 
    in his face!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Of course, after that everything will be over! The office will have 
    vanished off the face of the earth. I shall be arrested, I shall be tried, I 
    shall be dismissed from the service, thrown in prison, sent to Siberia. 
    Never mind! In fifteen years when they let me out of prison I will trudge 
    off to him, a beggar, in rags. I shall find him in some provincial town. He 
    will be married and happy. He will have a grown-up daughter.... I shall say 
    to him: "Look, monster, at my hollow cheeks and my rags! I've lost 
    everything每my career, my happiness, art, science, <I>the woman I loved,</I> 
    and all through you. Here are pistols. I have come to discharge my pistol 
    and...and I...forgive you. Then I shall fire into the air and he will hear 
    nothing more of me...."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at 
    that moment that all this was out of Pushkin's Silvio and Lermontov's 
    Masquerade. And all at once I felt horribly ashamed, so ashamed that I 
    stopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow in the 
    middle of the street. The driver gazed at me, sighing and astonished.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">What was I to do? I could not go on there每it was evidently stupid, and I 
    could not leave things as they were, because that would seem as though ... 
    Heavens, how could I leave things! And after such insults! "No!" I cried, 
    throwing myself into the sledge again. "It is ordained! It is fate! Drive 
    on, drive on!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the 
    neck.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What are you up to? What are you hitting me for?" the peasant shouted, 
    but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless 
    of it. I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap, and 
    felt with horror that it was going to happen <I>now, at once,</I> and that 
    <I>no force could stop it</I>. The deserted street lamps gleamed sullenly in 
    the showy darkness like torches at a funeral. The snow drifted under my 
    great-coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted there. I did not wrap 
    myself up每all was lost, anyway.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">At last we arrived. I jumped out, almost unconscious, rail up the steps 
    and began knocking and kicking at the door. I felt fearfully weak, 
    particularly in my legs and knees. The door was opened quickly as though 
    they knew I was coming. As a fact, Simonov had warned them that perhaps 
    another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which one had to 
    give notice and to observe certain precautions. It was one of those 
    "millinery establishments" which were abolished by the police a good time 
    ago. By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had an introduction, 
    one might visit it for other purposes.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing- room, 
    where there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement: there 
    was no one there. "Where are they?" I asked somebody. But by now, of course, 
    they had separated. Before me was standing a person with a stupid smile, the 
    "madam" herself, who had seen me before. A minute later a door opened and 
    another person came in.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Taking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I 
    talked to myself. I felt as though I had been saved from death and was 
    conscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I 
    should certainly, certainly have given it! But now they were not here 
    and...everything had vanished and changed! I looked round. I could not 
    realise my condition yet. I looked mechanically at the girl who had come in: 
    and had a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face, with straight, dark 
    eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes that attracted me at 
    once; I should have hated her if she had been smiling. I began looking at 
    her more intently and, as it were, with effort. I had not fully collected my 
    thoughts. There was something simple and good-natured in her face, but 
    something strangely grave. I am sure that this stood in her way here, and no 
    one of those fools had noticed her. She could not, however, have been called 
    a beauty, though she was tall, strong-looking, and well built. She was very 
    simply dressed. Something loathsome stirred within me. I went straight up to 
    her.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I chanced to look into the glass. My harassed face struck me as revolting 
    in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair. "No matter, I am 
    glad of it," I thought; "I am glad that I shall seem repulsive to her; I 
    like that."</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">VI</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">...Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though oppressed 
    by something, as though someone were strangling it. After an unnaturally 
    prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as it were 
    unexpectedly rapid, chime每as though someone were suddenly jumping forward. 
    It struck two. I woke up, though I had indeed not been asleep but lying 
    half-conscious.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room, 
    cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and all 
    sorts of frippery and litter. The candle end that had been burning on the 
    table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time. In a few 
    minutes there would be complete darkness.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at 
    once, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon me 
    again. And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point seemed continually 
    to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it my dreams moved drearily. 
    But strange to say, everything that had happened to me in that day seemed to 
    me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away past, as though I had long, 
    long ago lived all that down.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">My head was full of fumes. Something seemed to be hovering over me, 
    rousing me, exciting me, and making me restless. Misery and spite seemed 
    surging up in me again and seeking an outlet. Suddenly I saw beside me two 
    wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and persistently. The look in those 
    eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it were utterly remote; it weighed upon 
    me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a horrible 
    sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and mouldy cellar. 
    There was something unnatural in those two eyes, beginning to look at me 
    only now. I recalled, too, that during those two hours I had not said a 
    single word to this creature, and had, in fact, considered it utterly 
    superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some reason gratified me. Now I 
    suddenly realised vividly the hideous idea每revolting as a spider每of vice, 
    which, without love, grossly and shamelessly begins with that in which true 
    love finds its consummation. For a long time we gazed at each other like 
    that, but she did not drop her eyes before mine and her expression did not 
    change, so that at last I felt uncomfortable.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What is your name?" I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Liza," she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from 
    graciously, and she turned her eyes away.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was silent.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What weather! The snow...it's disgusting!" I said, almost to myself, 
    putting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She made no answer. This was horrible.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Have you always lived in Petersburg?" I asked a minute later, almost 
    angrily, turning my head slightly towards her.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Where do you come from?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"From Riga," she answered reluctantly.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Are you a German?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No, Russian."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Have you been here long?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Where?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"In this house?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"A fortnight."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She spoke more and more jerkily. The candle went out; I could no longer 
    distinguish her face.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Have you a father and mother?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Yes...no...I have."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Where are they?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"There...in Riga."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What are they?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, nothing."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Nothing? Why, what class are they?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Tradespeople."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Have you always lived with them?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Yes."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"How old are you?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Twenty."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why did you leave them?" </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, for no reason."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">That answer meant "Let me alone; I feel sick, sad."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">We were silent.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">God knows why I did not go away. I felt myself more and more sick and 
    dreary. The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from my 
    will, flitting through my memory in confusion. I suddenly recalled something 
    I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was hurrying to 
    the office.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it," 
    I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but as 
    it were by accident.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"A coffin?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"From a cellar?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Not from a cellar, but a basement. Oh, you know...down below...from a 
    house of ill-fame. It was filthy all round...Egg-shells, litter...a stench. 
    It was loathsome."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Silence.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"A nasty day to be buried," I began, simply to avoid being silent.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Nasty, in what way?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"The snow, the wet." (I yawned.)</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It makes no difference," she said suddenly, after a brief silence.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No, it's horrid." (I yawned again). "The gravediggers must have sworn at 
    getting drenched by the snow. And there must have been water in the 
    grave."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why water in the grave?" she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but 
    speaking even more harshly and abruptly than before.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I suddenly began to feel provoked.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep. You can't dig 
    a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why? Why, the place is waterlogged. It's a regular marsh. So they bury 
    them in water. I've seen it myself...many times."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had 
    only heard stories of it.)</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Do you mean to say, you don't mind how you die?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But why should I die?" she answered, as though defending herself.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that dead 
    woman. She was...a girl like you. She died of consumption."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"A wench would have died in hospital..." (She knows all about it already: 
    she said "wench," not "girl.")</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"She was in debt to her madam," I retorted, more and more provoked by the 
    discussion; "and went on earning money for her up to the end, though she was 
    in consumption. Some sledge-drivers standing by were talking about her to 
    some soldiers and telling them so. No doubt they knew her. They were 
    laughing. They were going to meet in a pot-house to drink to her 
memory."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">A great deal of this was my invention. Silence followed, profound 
    silence. She did not stir.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And is it better to die in a hospital?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Isn't it just the same? Besides, why should I die?" she added 
    irritably.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"If not now, a little later."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why a little later?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why, indeed? Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high price. 
    But after another year of this life you will be very different每you will go 
    off."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"In a year?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Anyway, in a year you will be worth less," I continued malignantly. "You 
    will go from here to something lower, another house; a year later每to a 
    third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to a basement in 
    the Haymarket. That will be if you were lucky. But it would be much worse if 
    you got some disease, consumption, say...and caught a chill, or something or 
    other. It's not easy to get over an illness in your way of life. If you 
    catch anything you may not get rid of it. And so you would die."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, well, then I shall die," she answered, quite vindictively, and she 
    made a quick movement.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But one is sorry."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Sorry for whom?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Sorry for life."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Silence.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Have you been engaged to be married? Eh?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What's that to you?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, I am not cross-examining you. It's nothing to me. Why are you so 
    cross? Of course you may have had your own troubles. What is it to me? It's 
    simply that I felt sorry."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Sorry for whom?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Sorry for you."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No need," she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint 
    movement.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">That incensed me at once. What! I was so gentle with her, and she 
....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why, do you think that you are on the right path?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I don't think anything."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"That's what's wrong, that you don't think. Realise it while there is 
    still time. There still is time. You are still young, good-looking; you 
    might love, be married, be happy... ."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Not all married women are happy," she snapped out in the rude abrupt 
    tone she had used at first.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here. 
    Infinitely better. Besides, with love one can live even without happiness. 
    Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one lives. But here 
    what is there but...foulness? Phew!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I began to 
    feel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject. I was already 
    longing to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my corner. 
    Something suddenly flared up in me. An object had appeared before me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you. I am, perhaps, 
    worse than you are. I was drunk when I came here, though," I hastened, 
    however, to say in self-defence. "Besides, a man is no example for a woman. 
    It's a different thing. I may degrade and defile myself, but I am not 
    anyone's slave. I come and go, and that's an end of it. I shake it off, and 
    I am a different man. But you are a slave from the start. Yes, a slave! You 
    give up everything, your whole freedom. If you want to break your chains 
    afterwards, you won't be able to; you will be more and more fast in the 
    snares. It is an accursed bondage. I know it. I won't speak of anything 
    else, maybe you won't understand, but tell me: no doubt you are in debt to 
    your madam? There, you see," I added, though she made no answer, but only 
    listened in silence, entirely absorbed, "that's a bondage for you! You will 
    never buy your freedom. They will see to that. It's like selling your soul 
    to the devil.... And besides ... perhaps, I too, am just as unlucky每how do 
    you know每and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of misery? You know, men take 
    to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here from grief. Come, tell me, what 
    is there good here? Here you and I...came together...just now and did not 
    say one word to one another all the time, and it was only afterwards you 
    began staring at me like a wild creature, and I at you. Is that loving? Is 
    that how one human being should meet another? It's hideous, that's what it 
    is!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Yes!" she assented sharply and hurriedly.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this "Yes." So the same 
    thought may have been straying through her mind when she was staring at me 
    just before. So she, too, was capable of certain thoughts? "Damn it all, 
    this was interesting, this was a point of likeness!" I thought, almost 
    rubbing my hands. And indeed it's easy to turn a young soul like that!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness 
    that she propped herself on her arm. Perhaps she was scrutinising me. How I 
    regretted that I could not see her eyes. I heard her deep breathing.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why have you come here?" I asked her, with a note of authority already 
    in my voice.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, I don't know."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But how nice it would be to be living in your father's house! It's warm 
    and free; you have a home of your own."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But what if it's worse than this?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I must take the right tone," flashed through my mind. "I may not get far 
    with sentimentality." But it was only a momentary thought. I swear she 
    really did interest me. Besides, I was exhausted and moody. And cunning so 
    easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Who denies it!" I hastened to answer. "Anything may happen. I am 
    convinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned against 
    than sinning. Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it's not likely a 
    girl like you has come here of her own inclination... ."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"A girl like me?" she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Damn it all, I was flattering her. That was horrid. But perhaps it was a 
    good thing.... She was silent.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"See, Liza, I will tell you about myself. If I had had a home from 
    childhood, I shouldn't be what I am now. I often think that. However bad it 
    may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not enemies, 
    strangers. Once a year at least, they'll show their love of you. Anyway, you 
    know you are at home. I grew up without a home; and perhaps that's why I've 
    turned so...unfeeling."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I waited again. "Perhaps she doesn't understand," I thought, "and, 
    indeed, it is absurd每it's moralising."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my 
    daughter more than my sons, really," I began indirectly, as though talking 
    of something else, to distract her attention. I must confess I blushed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why so?" she asked.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Ah! so she was listening!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I don't know, Liza. I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but 
    used to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands, her 
    feet, he couldn't make enough of her, really. When she danced at parties he 
    used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her. He was mad over 
    her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at night, and he would 
    wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her. He 
    would go about in a dirty old coat, he was stingy to everyone else, but 
    would spend his last penny for her, giving her expensive presents, and it 
    was his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he gave her. Fathers 
    always love their daughters more than the mothers do. Some girls live 
    happily at home! And I believe I should never let my daughters marry."
    </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What next?" she said, with a faint smile.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I should be jealous, I really should. To think that she should kiss 
    anyone else! That she should love a stranger more than her father! It's 
    painful to imagine it. Of course, that's all nonsense, of course every 
    father would be reasonable at last. But I believe before I should let her 
    marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all her 
    suitors. But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself loved. The 
    one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the father, you know. 
    That is always so. So many family troubles come from that."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying them 
    honourably."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Ah, so that was it!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which there is 
    neither love nor God," I retorted warmly, "and where there is no love, there 
    is no sense either. There are such families, it's true, but I am not 
    speaking of them. You must have seen wickedness in your own family, if you 
    talk like that. Truly, you must have been unlucky. H'm! ...that sort of 
    thing mostly comes about through poverty."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And is it any better with the gentry? Even among the poor, honest people 
    who live happily?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"H'm...yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up his 
    troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought, he 
    would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it. And what if 
    all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is upon it, if the 
    husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you! There is 
    happiness in such a family! Even sometimes there is happiness in the midst 
    of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere. If you marry <I>you will find 
    out for yourself</I>. But think of the first years of married life with one 
    you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in it! And 
    indeed it's the ordinary thing. In those early days even quarrels with one's 
    husband end happily. Some women get up quarrels with their husbands just 
    because they love them. Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say 
    that because she loved him, she would torment him and make him feel it. You 
    know that you may torment a man on purpose through love. Women are 
    particularly given to that, thinking to themselves 'I will love him so, I 
    will make so much of him afterwards, that it's no sin to torment him a 
    little now.' And all in the house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are 
    happy and gay and peaceful and honourable.... Then there are some women who 
    are jealous. If he went off anywhere每I knew one such woman, she couldn't 
    restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find 
    out where he was, whether he was with some other woman. That's a pity. And 
    the woman knows herself it's wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, 
    but she loves每it's all through love. And how sweet it is to make up after 
    quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or to forgive him! And they both are 
    so happy all at once每as though they had met anew, been married over again; 
    as though their love had begun afresh. And no one, no one should know what 
    passes between husband and wife if they love one another. And whatever 
    quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in their own 
    mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another. They are their 
    own judges. Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other 
    eyes, whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They respect one 
    another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been love, 
    if they have been married for love, why should love pass away? Surely one 
    can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind 
    and straightforward, why should not love last? The first phase of married 
    love will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love that is better 
    still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have everything in 
    common, there will be no secrets between them. And once they have children, 
    the most difficult times will seem to them happy, so long as there is love 
    and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your 
    children and even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; 
    so you are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that 
    you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your 
    children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have 
    received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness. So 
    you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and mother 
    nearer? People say it's a trial to have children. Who says that? It is 
    heavenly happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am awfully fond 
    of them. You know每a little rosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband's 
    heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his child! A plump little rosy 
    baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny 
    little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to took at them; eyes that 
    look as if they understand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at 
    your bosom with its little hand, plays. When its father comes up, the child 
    tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, 
    laughs, as though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it 
    will bite its mother's breast when its little teeth are coming, while it 
    looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, 'Look, I am 
    biting!' Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, 
    husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of such 
    moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before one blames 
    others!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It's by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you," I thought to 
    myself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I flushed 
    crimson. "What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what should I do 
    then?" That idea drove me to fury. Towards the end of my speech I really was 
    excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded. The silence continued. I 
    almost nudged her.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why are you每" she began and stopped. But I understood: there was a 
    quiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and unyielding 
    as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced that I suddenly 
    felt ashamed and guilty.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What?" I asked, with tender curiosity</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why, you ..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why, you ... speak somehow like a book," she said, and again there was a 
    note of irony in her voice.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">That remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that 
    this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the 
    privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their 
    pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from 
    giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to have guessed the 
    truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly approached her 
    sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with an effort. But I did 
    not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Wait a bit!" I thought.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">VII</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, hush, Liza! How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes 
    even me, an outsider, feel sick? Though I don't look at it as an outsider, 
    for, indeed, it touches me to the heart.... Is it possible, is it possible 
    that you do not feel sick at being here yourself? Evidently habit does 
    wonders! God knows what habit can do with anyone. Can you seriously think 
    that you will never grow old, that you will always be good-looking, and that 
    they will keep you here for ever and ever? I say nothing of the 
    loathsomeness of the life here.... Though let me tell you this about 
    it每about your present life, I mean; here though you are young now, 
    attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon as I came to 
    myself just now I felt at once sick at being here with you! One can only 
    come here when one is drunk. But if you were anywhere else, living as good 
    people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted by you, should fall in 
    love with you, should be glad of a look from you, let alone a word; I should 
    hang about your door, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon 
    you as my betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not 
    dare to have an impure thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I 
    have only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or 
    not. I don't consult your wishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer hires 
    himself as a workman, but he doesn't make a slave of himself altogether; 
    besides, he knows that he will be free again presently. But when are you 
    free? Only think what you are giving up here? What is it you are making a 
    slave of? It is your soul, together with your body; you are selling your 
    soul which you have no right to dispose of! You give your love to be 
    outraged by every drunkard! Love! But that's everything, you know, it's a 
    priceless diamond, it's a maiden's treasure, love每why, a man would be ready 
    to give his soul, to face death to gain that love. But how much is your love 
    worth now? You are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to 
    strive for love when you can have everything without love. And you know 
    there is no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand? To be 
    sure, I have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have 
    lovers of your own here. But you know that's simply a farce, that's simply a 
    sham, it's just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do you 
    suppose he really loves you, that lover of yours? I don't believe it. How 
    can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute? He 
    would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of respect for you? 
    What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and robs you每that is all 
    his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does not beat you. Very likely he 
    does beat you, too. Ask him, if you have got one, whether he will marry you. 
    He will laugh in your face, if he doesn't spit in it or give you a 
    blow每though maybe he is not worth a bad halfpenny himself. And for what have 
    you ruined your life, if you come to think of it? For the coffee they give 
    you to drink and the plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding 
    you up? An honest girl couldn't swallow the food, for she would know what 
    she was being fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will always 
    be in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the visitors here 
    begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don't rely upon your 
    youth每all that flies by express train here, you know. You will be kicked 
    out. And not simply kicked out; long before that she'll begin nagging at 
    you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not sacrificed your health 
    for her, had not thrown away your youth and your soul for her benefit, but 
    as though you had ruined her, beggared her, robbed her. And don't expect 
    anyone to take your part: the others, your companions, will attack you, too, 
    win her favour, for all are in slavery here, and have lost all conscience 
    and pity here long ago. They have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth 
    is viler, more loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse. And you are 
    laying down everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty 
    and hope, and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, 
    and you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No 
    doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do! Yet 
    there is no work harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has been. One 
    would think that the heart alone would be worn out with tears. And you won't 
    dare to say a word, not half a word when they drive you away from here; you 
    will go away as though you were to blame. You will change to another house, 
    then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come down at last to the 
    Haymarket. There you will be beaten at every turn; that is good manners 
    there, the visitors don't know how to be friendly without beating you. You 
    don't believe that it is so hateful there? Go and look for yourself some 
    time, you can see with your own eyes. Once, one New Year's Day, I saw a 
    woman at a door. They had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of 
    the frost because she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind 
    her. At nine o'clock in the morning she was already quite drunk, 
    dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was powdered, but 
    she had a black-eye, blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth; some 
    cabman had just given her a drubbing. She was sitting on the stone steps, a 
    salt fish of some sort was in her hand; she was crying, wailing something 
    about her luck and beating with the fish on the steps, and cabmen and 
    drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway taunting her. You don't 
    believe that you will ever be like that? I should be sorry to believe it, 
    too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago that very woman 
    with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no 
    evil, blushing at every word. Perhaps she was like you, proud, ready to take 
    offence, not like the others; perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what 
    happiness was in store for the man who should love her and whom she should 
    love. Do you see how it ended? And what if at that very minute when she was 
    beating on the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled每what if 
    at that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father's house, 
    when she used to go to school and the neighbour's son watched for her on the 
    way, declaring that he would love her as long as he lived, that he would 
    devote his life to her, and when they vowed to love one another for ever and 
    be married as soon as they were grown up! No, Liza, it would be happy for 
    you if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar 
    like that woman just now. In the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if 
    they take you, but what if you are still of use to the madam here? 
    Consumption is a queer disease, it is not like fever. The patient goes on 
    hoping till the last minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself. 
    And that just suits your madam. Don't doubt it, that's how it is; you have 
    sold your soul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren't say a word. 
    But when you are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from you, 
    for then there will be nothing to get from you. What's more, they will 
    reproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying. However 
    you beg you won't get a drink of water without abuse: 'Whenever are you 
    going off, you nasty hussy, you won't let us sleep with your moaning, you 
    make the gentlemen sick.' That's true, I have heard such things said myself. 
    They will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner in the cellar每in the 
    damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be, lying there alone? When you 
    die, strange hands will lay you out, with grumbling and impatience; no one 
    will bless you, no one will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you 
    as soon as may be; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as they did 
    that poor woman today, and celebrate your memory at the tavern. In the 
    grave, sleet, filth, wet snow每no need to put themselves out for you每'Let her 
    down, Vanuha; it's just like her luck每even here, she is head-foremost, the 
    hussy. Shorten the cord, you rascal.' 'It's all right as it is.' 'All right, 
    is it? Why, she's on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But, 
    never mind, throw the earth on her.' And they won't care to waste much time 
    quarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick as they 
    can and go off to the tavern ... and there your memory on earth will end; 
    other women have children to go to their graves, fathers, husbands. While 
    for you neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one in the whole world 
    will ever come to you, your name will vanish from the face of the earth每as 
    though you had never existed, never been born at all! Nothing but filth and 
    mud, however you knock at your coffin lid at night, when the dead arise, 
    however you cry: 'Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of day! My 
    life was no life at all; my life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it 
    was drunk away in the tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to 
    live in the world again.'"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in my 
    throat myself, and...and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay and, 
    bending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart. I had 
    reason to be troubled.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and 
    rending her heart, and每and the more I was convinced of it, the more eagerly 
    I desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as possible. It 
    was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it was not merely 
    sport....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I 
    could not speak except "like a book." But that did not trouble me: I knew, I 
    felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness might be an 
    assistance. But now, having attained my effect, I was suddenly 
    panic-stricken. Never before had I witnessed such despair! She was lying on 
    her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching it in both hands. 
    Her heart was being torn. Her youthful body was shuddering all over as 
    though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs rent her bosom and suddenly burst out 
    in weeping and walling, then she pressed closer into the pillow: she did not 
    want anyone here, not a living soul, to know of her anguish and her tears. 
    She bit the pillow, bit her hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, 
    thrusting her fingers into her dishevelled hair, seemed rigid with the 
    effort of restraint, holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I began 
    saying something, begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; 
    and all at once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling 
    in the dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark; though I 
    tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a box of 
    matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. As soon as the room was 
    lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a contorted face, with a 
    half insane smile, looked at me almost senselessly. I sat down beside her 
    and took her hands; she came to herself, made an impulsive movement towards 
    me, would have caught hold of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her 
    head before me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Liza, my dear, I was wrong...forgive me, my dear," I began, but she 
    squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the 
    wrong thing and stopped.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"This is my address, Liza, come to me."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I will come," she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"But now I am going, good-bye...till we meet again."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a 
    shudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled herself 
    in it to her chin. As she did this she gave another sickly smile, blushed 
    and looked at me strangely. I felt wretched; I was in haste to get away每to 
    disappear.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Wait a minute," she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway, 
    stopping me with her hand on my overcoat. She put down the candle in hot 
    haste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted to show 
    me something. As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and there was a 
    smile on her lips每what was the meaning of it? Against my will I waited: she 
    came back a minute later with an expression that seemed to ask forgiveness 
    for something. In fact, it was not the same face, not the same look as the 
    evening before: sullen, mistrustful and obstinate. Her eyes now were 
    imploring, soft, and at the same time trustful, caressing, timid. The 
    expression with which children look at people they are very fond of, of whom 
    they are asking a favour. Her eyes were a light hazel, they were lovely 
    eyes, full of life, and capable of expressing love as well as sullen 
    hatred.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Making no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must 
    understand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of paper to 
    me. Her whole face was positively beaming at that instant with naive, almost 
    childish, triumph. I unfolded it. It was a letter to her from a medical 
    student or someone of that sort每a very high-flown and flowery, but extremely 
    respectful, love-letter. I don't recall the words now, but I remember well 
    that through the high-flown phrases there was apparent a genuine feeling, 
    which cannot be feigned. When I had finished reading it I met her glowing, 
    questioning, and childishly impatient eyes fixed upon me. She fastened her 
    eyes upon my face and waited impatiently for what I should say. In a few 
    words, hurriedly, but with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to me that 
    she had been to a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of "very nice 
    people, <I>who knew nothing,</I> absolutely nothing, for she had only come 
    here so lately and it had all happened...and she hadn't made up her mind to 
    stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid her debt..." and 
    at that party there had been the student who had danced with her all the 
    evening. He had talked to her, and it turned out that he had known her in 
    old days at Riga when he was a child, they had played together, but a very 
    long time ago每and he knew her parents, but <I>about this</I> he knew 
    nothing, nothing whatever, and had no suspicion! And the day after the dance 
    (three days ago) he had sent her that letter through the friend with whom 
    she had gone to the party...and...well, that was all."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she 
    finished.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The poor girl was keeping that student's letter as a precious treasure, 
    and had run to fetch it, her only treasure, because she did not want me to 
    go away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely loved; 
    that she, too, was addressed respectfully. No doubt that letter was destined 
    to lie in her box and lead to nothing. But none the less, I am certain that 
    she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure, as her pride and 
    justification, and now at such a minute she had thought of that letter and 
    brought it with naive pride to raise herself in my eyes that I might see, 
    that I, too, might think well of her. I said nothing, pressed her hand and 
    went out. I so longed to get away...I walked all the way home, in spite of 
    the fact that the melting snow was still falling in heavy flakes. I was 
    exhausted, shattered, in bewilderment. But behind the bewilderment the truth 
    was already gleaming. The loathsome truth.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">VIII</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It was some time, however, before I consented to recognise that truth. 
    Waking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and 
    immediately realising all that had happened on the previous day, I was 
    positively amazed at my last night's <I>sentimentality</I> with Liza, at all 
    those "outcries of horror and pity." "To think of having such an attack of 
    womanish hysteria, pah!" I concluded. And what did I thrust my address upon 
    her for? What if she comes? Let her come, though; it doesn't matter....But 
    <I>obviously,</I> that was not now the chief and the most important matter: 
    I had to make haste and at all costs save my reputation in the eyes of 
    Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible; that was the chief business. And 
    I was so taken up that morning that I actually forgot all about Liza.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">First of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before 
    from Simonov. I resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen roubles 
    straight off from Anton Antonitch. As luck would have it he was in the best 
    of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once, on the first asking. I 
    was so delighted at this that, as I signed the IOU with a swaggering air, I 
    told him casually that the night before "I had been keeping it up with some 
    friends at the Hotel de Paris; we were giving a farewell party to a comrade, 
    in fact, I might say a friend of my childhood, and you know每a desperate 
    rake, fearfully spoilt每of course, he belongs to a good family, and has 
    considerable means, a brilliant career; he is witty, charming, a regular 
    Lovelace, you understand; we drank an extra 'half-dozen' and..." And it went 
    off all right; all this was uttered very easily, unconstrainedly and 
    complacently.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">On reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">To this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly gentlemanly, 
    good-humoured, candid tone of my letter. With tact and good-breeding, and, 
    above all, entirely without superfluous words, I blamed myself for all that 
    had happened. I defended myself, "if I really may be allowed to defend 
    myself," by alleging that being utterly unaccustomed to wine, I had been 
    intoxicated with the first glass, which I said, I had drunk before they 
    arrived, while I was waiting for them at the Hotel de Paris between five and 
    six o'clock. I begged Simonov's pardon especially; I asked him to convey my 
    explanations to all the others, especially to Zverkov, whom "I seemed to 
    remember as though in a dream" I had insulted. I added that I would have 
    called upon all of them myself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the 
    face to. I was particularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost 
    carelessness (strictly within the bounds of politeness, however), which was 
    apparent in my style, and better than any possible arguments, gave them at 
    once to understand that I took rather an independent view of "all that 
    unpleasantness last night"; that I was by no means so utterly crushed as 
    you, my friends, probably imagine; but on the contrary, looked upon it as a 
    gentleman serenely respecting himself should look upon it. "On a young 
    hero's past no censure is cast!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!" I thought 
    admiringly, as I read over the letter. "And it's all because I am an 
    intellectual and cultivated man! Another man in my place would not have 
    known how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and am as 
    jolly as ever again, and all because I am 'a cultivated and educated man of 
    our day.' And, indeed, perhaps, everything was due to the wine yesterday. 
    H'm!" ...no, it was not the wine. I did not drink anything at all between 
    five and six when I was waiting for them. I had lied to Simonov; I had lied 
    shamelessly; and indeed I wasn't ashamed now.... Hang it all though, the 
    great thing was that I was rid of it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to take 
    it to Simonov. When he learned that there was money in the letter, Apollon 
    became more respectful and agreed to take it. Towards evening I went out for 
    a walk. My head was still aching and giddy after yesterday. But as evening 
    came on and the twilight grew denser, my impressions and, following them, my 
    thoughts, grew more and more different and confused. Something was not dead 
    within me, in the depths of my heart and conscience it would not die, and it 
    showed itself in acute depression. For the most part I jostled my way 
    through the most crowded business streets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along 
    Sadovy Street and in Yusupov Garden. I always liked particularly sauntering 
    along these streets in the dusk, just when there were crowds of working 
    people of all sorts going home from their daily work, with faces looking 
    cross with anxiety. What I liked was just that cheap bustle, that bare 
    prose. On this occasion the jostling of the streets irritated me more than 
    ever, I could not make out what was wrong with me, I could not find the 
    clue, something seemed rising up continually in my soul, painfully, and 
    refusing to be appeased. I returned home completely upset, it was just as 
    though some crime were lying on my conscience.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The thought that Liza was coming worried me continually. It seemed queer 
    to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented me, as it 
    were, especially, as it were, quite separately. Everything else I had quite 
    succeeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it all and was still 
    perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov. But on this point I was not 
    satisfied at all. It was as though I were worried only by Liza. "What if she 
    comes," I thought incessantly, "well, it doesn't matter, let her come! H'm! 
    it's horrid that she should see, for instance, how I live. Yesterday I 
    seemed such a hero to her, while now, h'm! It's horrid, though, that I have 
    let myself go so, the room looks like a beggar's. And I brought myself to go 
    out to dinner in such a suit! And my American leather sofa with the stuffing 
    sticking out. And my dressing-gown, which will not cover me, such tatters, 
    and she will see all this and she will see Apollon. That beast is certain to 
    insult her. He will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me. And I, of 
    course, shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing and scraping 
    before her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall begin smiling, 
    telling lies. Oh, the beastliness! And it isn't the beastliness of it that 
    matters most! There is something more important, more loathsome, viler! Yes, 
    viler! And to put on that dishonest lying mask again!..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">When I reached that thought I fired up all at once.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I 
    remember there was real feeling in me, too. What I wanted was to excite an 
    honourable feeling in her.... Her crying was a good thing, it will have a 
    good effect."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Yet I could not feel at ease. All that evening, even when I had come back 
    home, even after nine o'clock, when I calculated that Liza could not 
    possibly come, still she haunted me, and what was worse, she came back to my 
    mind always in the same position. One moment out of all that had happened 
    last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment when I struck a 
    match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look of torture. And what a 
    pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted smile she had at that moment! 
    But I did not know then, that fifteen years later I should still in my 
    imagination see Liza, always with the pitiful, distorted, inappropriate 
    smile which was on her face at that minute.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to 
    over-excited nerves, and, above all, as <I>exaggerated</I>. I was always 
    conscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of it. 
    "I exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong," I repeated to myself 
    every hour. But, however, "Liza will very likely come all the same," was the 
    refrain with which all my reflections ended. I was so uneasy that I 
    sometimes flew into a fury: "She'll come, she is certain to come!" I cried, 
    running about the room, "if not today, she will come tomorrow; she'll find 
    me out! The damnable romanticism of these pure hearts! Oh, the vileness每oh, 
    the silliness每oh, the stupidity of these 'wretched sentimental souls!' Why, 
    how fail to understand? How could one fall to understand?..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And how few, how few words," I thought, in passing, "were needed; how 
    little of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic too) 
    had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my will. That's 
    virginity, to be sure! Freshness of soil!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">At times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, "to tell her all," and 
    beg her not to come to me. But this thought stirred such wrath in me that I 
    believed I should have crushed that "damned" Liza if she had chanced to be 
    near me at the time. I should have insulted her, have spat at her, have 
    turned her out, have struck her!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I 
    began to grow calmer. I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine 
    o'clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for 
    instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me and 
    my talking to her....I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice that she 
    loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I don't know, 
    however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At last all confusion, 
    transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself at my feet and says 
    that I am her saviour, and that she loves me better than anything in the 
    world. I am amazed, but.... "Liza," I say, "can you imagine that I have not 
    noticed your love? I saw it all, I divined it, but I did not dare to 
    approach you first, because I had an influence over you and was afraid that 
    you would force yourself, from gratitude, to respond to my love, would try 
    to rouse in your heart a feeling which was perhaps absent, and I did not 
    wish that ... because it would be tyranny ... it would be indelicate" (in 
    short, I launch off at that point into European, inexplicably lofty 
    subtleties a la George Sand), "but now, now you are mine, you are my 
    creation, you are pure, you are good, you are my noble wife.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">'Into my house come bold and free, Its rightful mistress there to be'. 
    "Then we begin living together, go abroad and so on, and so on." In fact, in 
    the end it seemed vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out my tongue at 
    myself.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Besides, they won't let her out, "the hussy!" I thought. They don't let 
    them go out very readily, especially in the evening (for some reason I 
    fancied she would come in the evening, and at seven o'clock precisely). 
    Though she did say she was not altogether a slave there yet, and had certain 
    rights; so, h'm! Damn it all, she will come, she is sure to come!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at 
    that time by his rudeness. He drove me beyond all patience! He was the bane 
    of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence. We had been squabbling 
    continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I believe I 
    had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him, especially at some 
    moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who worked part of his time as a 
    tailor. But for some unknown reason he despised me beyond all measure, and 
    looked down upon me insufferably. Though, indeed, he looked down upon 
    everyone. Simply to glance at that flaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the 
    tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead and oiled with sunflower oil, at 
    that dignified mouth, compressed into the shape of the letter V, made one 
    feel one was confronting a man who never doubted of himself. He was a 
    pedant, to the most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, 
    and with that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in 
    love with every button on his coat, every nail on his fingers每absolutely in 
    love with them, and he looked it! In his behaviour to me he was a perfect 
    tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he 
    gave me a firm, majestically self-confident and invariably ironical look 
    that drove me sometimes to fury. He did his work with the air of doing me 
    the greatest favour, though he did scarcely anything for me, and did not, 
    indeed, consider himself bound to do anything. There could be no doubt that 
    he looked upon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that "he did not get 
    rid of me" was simply that he could get wages from me every month. He 
    consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month. Many sins should 
    be forgiven me for what I suffered from him. My hatred reached such a point 
    that sometimes his very step almost threw me into convulsions. What I 
    loathed particularly was his lisp. His tongue must have been a little too 
    long or something of that sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be 
    very proud of it, imagining that it greatly added to his dignity. He spoke 
    in a slow, measured tone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed 
    on the ground. He maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to 
    himself behind his partition. Many a battle I waged over that reading! But 
    he was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, 
    sing-song voice, as though over the dead. It is interesting that that is how 
    he has ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead, and at 
    the same time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at that time I could not 
    get rid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my 
    existence. Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave me. I 
    could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my 
    shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon 
    seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven 
    years I could not turn him away. </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">To be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was 
    impossible. He would have made such a fuss, I should not have known where to 
    hide my head. But I was so exasperated with everyone during those days, that 
    I made up my mind for some reason and with some object to <I>punish</I> 
    Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that were owing him. I 
    had for a long time每for the last two years每been intending to do this, simply 
    in order to teach him not to give himself airs with me, and to show him that 
    if I liked I could withhold his wages. I purposed to say nothing to him 
    about it, and was purposely silent indeed, in order to score off his pride 
    and force him to be the first to speak of his wages. Then I would take the 
    seven roubles out of a drawer, show him I have the money put aside on 
    purpose, but that I won't, I won't, I simply won't pay him his wages, I 
    won't just because that is "what I wish," because "I am master, and it is 
    for me to decide," because he has been disrespectful, because he has been 
    rude; but if he were to ask respectfully I might be softened and give it to 
    him, otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a whole 
    month....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But angry as I was, yet he got the better of me. I could not hold out for 
    four days. He began as he always did begin in such cases, for there had been 
    such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may be observed I knew 
    all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by heart). He would begin by 
    fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare, keeping it up for several 
    minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me or seeing me out of the house. 
    If I held out and pretended not to notice these stares, he would, still in 
    silence, proceed to further tortures. All at once, a propos of nothing, he 
    would walk softly and smoothly into my room, when I was pacing up and down 
    or reading, stand at the door, one hand behind his back and one foot behind 
    the other, and fix upon me a stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous. 
    If I suddenly asked him what he wanted, he would make me no answer, but 
    continue staring at me persistently for some seconds, then, with a peculiar 
    compression of his lips and a most significant air, deliberately turn round 
    and deliberately go back to his room. Two hours later he would come out 
    again and again present himself before me in the same way. It had happened 
    that in my fury I did not even ask him what he wanted, but simply raised my 
    head sharply and imperiously and began staring back at him. So we stared at 
    one another for two minutes; at last he turned with deliberation and dignity 
    and went back again for two hours.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my 
    revolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long, deep 
    sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral degradation, and, 
    of course, it ended at last by his triumphing completely: I raged and 
    shouted, but still was forced to do what he wanted.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost my 
    temper and flew at him in a fury. I was irritated beyond endurance apart 
    from him.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Stay," I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning, with 
    one hand behind his back, to go to his room. "Stay! Come back, come back, I 
    tell you!" and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he turned round and 
    even looked at me with some wonder. However, he persisted in saying nothing, 
    and that infuriated me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"How dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for? 
    Answer!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round 
    again.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Stay!" I roared, running up to him, "don't stir! There. Answer, now: 
    what did you come in to look at?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"If you have any order to give me it's my duty to carry it out," he 
    answered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp, raising 
    his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to another, all this 
    with exasperating composure.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"That's not what I am asking you about, you torturer!" I shouted, turning 
    crimson with anger. "I'll tell you why you came here myself: you see, I 
    don't give you your wages, you are so proud you don't want to bow down and 
    ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your stupid stares, to worry 
    me and you have no sus...pic...ion how stupid it is每stupid, stupid, stupid, 
    stupid! ..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">He would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Listen," I shouted to him. "Here's the money, do you see, here it is," 
    (I took it out of the table drawer); "here's the seven roubles complete, but 
    you are not going to have it, you...are...not...going...to...have it until 
    you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my pardon. Do you hear?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"That cannot be," he answered, with the most unnatural 
    self-confidence.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"It shall be so," I said, "I give you my word of honour, it shall 
be!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And there's nothing for me to beg your pardon for," he went on, as 
    though he had not noticed my exclamations at all. "Why, besides, you called 
    me a 'torturer,' for which I can summon you at the police-station at any 
    time for insulting behaviour."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Go, summon me," I roared, "go at once, this very minute, this very 
    second! You are a torturer all the same! a torturer!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud calls 
    to him, he walked to his room with an even step and without looking 
    round.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened," I 
    decided inwardly. Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind his 
    screen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating slowly 
    and violently.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Apollon," I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless, "go 
    at once without a minute's delay and fetch the police-officer."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">He had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles and 
    taken up some sewing. But, hearing my order, he burst into a guffaw.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"At once, go this minute! Go on, or else you can't imagine what will 
    happen."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You are certainly out of your mind," he observed, without even raising 
    his head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle. "Whoever 
    heard of a man sending for the police against himself? And as for being 
    frightened每you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for nothing will come 
    of it."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Go!" I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder. I felt I should strike 
    him in a minute.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open at 
    that instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at us in 
    perplexity I glanced, nearly swooned with shame, and rushed back to my room. 
    There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I leaned my head against the 
    wall and stood motionless in that position.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Two minutes later I heard Apollon's deliberate footsteps. "There is some 
    woman asking for you," he said, looking at me with peculiar severity. Then 
    he stood aside and let in Liza. He would not go away, but stared at us 
    sarcastically.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Go away, go away," I commanded in desperation. At that moment my clock 
    began whirring and wheezing and struck seven.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">IX</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Into my house come bold and free, Its rightful mistress there to 
be."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I 
    believe I smiled as I did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my 
    ragged wadded dressing-gown每exactly as I had imagined the scene not long 
    before in a fit of depression. After standing over us for a couple of 
    minutes Apollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease. What made 
    it worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion, more so, in 
    fact, than I should have expected. At the sight of me, of course.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Sit down," I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I 
    sat down on the sofa. She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me 
    open-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once. This naivete of 
    expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as 
    usual, while instead of that, she...and I dimly felt that I should make her 
    pay dearly for <I>all this</I>.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"You have found me in a strange position, Liza," I began, stammering and 
    knowing that this was the wrong way to begin. "No, no, don't imagine 
    anything," I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed. "I am not ashamed 
    of my poverty...On the contrary, I look with pride on my poverty. I am poor 
    but honourable....One can be poor and honourable," I muttered. 
    "However...would you like tea?...."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"No," she was beginning.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Wait a minute."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I leapt up and ran to Apollon. I had to get out of the room somehow.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Apollon," I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the 
    seven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist, "here are 
    your wages, you see I give them to you; but for that you must come to my 
    rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant. If you won't go, 
    you'll make me a miserable man! You don't know what this woman is....This 
    is每everything! You may be imagining something....But you don't know what 
    that woman is! ..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Apollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his spectacles 
    again, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking or putting 
    down his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention to me or 
    making any answer, he went on busying himself with his needle, which he had 
    not yet threaded. I waited before him for three minutes with my arms crossed 
    a la Napoleon. My temples were moist with sweat. I was pale, I felt it. But, 
    thank God, he must have been moved to pity, looking at me. Having threaded 
    his needle he deliberately got up from his seat, deliberately moved back his 
    chair, deliberately took off his spectacles, deliberately counted the money, 
    and finally asking me over his shoulder: "Shall I get a whole portion?" 
    deliberately walked out of the room. As I was going back to Liza, the 
    thought occurred to me on the way: shouldn't I run away just as I was in my 
    dressing-gown, no matter where, and then let happen what would?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I sat down again. She looked at me uneasily. For some minutes we were 
    silent.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I will kill him," I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist so 
    that the ink spurted out of the inkstand.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What are you saying!" she cried, starting.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I will kill him! kill him!" I shrieked, suddenly striking the table in 
    absolute frenzy, and at the same time fully understanding how stupid it was 
    to be in such a frenzy. "You don't know, Liza, what that torturer is to me. 
    He is my torturer....He has gone now to fetch some rusks; he ..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And suddenly I burst into tears. It was an hysterical attack. How ashamed 
    I felt in the midst of my sobs; but still I could not restrain them.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She was frightened.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"What is the matter? What is wrong?" she cried, fussing about me.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Water, give me water, over there!" I muttered in a faint voice, though I 
    was inwardly conscious that I could have got on very well without water and 
    without muttering in a faint voice. But I was, what is called, <I>putting it 
    on,</I> to save appearances, though the attack was a genuine one.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment. At that moment Apollon 
    brought in the tea. It suddenly seemed to me that this commonplace, prosaic 
    tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all that had happened, and I 
    blushed crimson. Liza looked at Apollon with positive alarm. He went out 
    without a glance at either of us.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Liza, do you despise me?" I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling 
    with impatience to know what she was thinking.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She was confused, and did not know what to answer.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Drink your tea," I said to her angrily. I was angry with myself, but, of 
    course, it was she who would have to pay for it. A horrible spite against 
    her suddenly surged up in my heart; I believe I could have killed her. To 
    revenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a word to her all the 
    time. "She is the cause of it all," I thought.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Our silence lasted for five minutes. The tea stood on the table; we did 
    not touch it. I had got to the point of purposely refraining from beginning 
    in order to embarrass her further; it was awkward for her to begin alone. 
    Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity. I was obstinately 
    silent. I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer, because I was fully 
    conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful stupidity, and yet at 
    the same time I could not restrain myself.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"I want to...get away...from there altogether," she began, to break the 
    silence in some way, but, poor girl, that was just what she ought not to 
    have spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as I was. My 
    heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and unnecessary 
    straightforwardness. But something hideous at once stifled all compassion in 
    me; it even provoked me to greater venom. I did not care what happened. 
    Another five minutes passed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Perhaps I am in your way," she began timidly, hardly audibly, and was 
    getting up.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But as soon as I saw this first impulse of wounded dignity I positively 
    trembled with spite, and at once burst out.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Why have you come to me, tell me that, please?" I began, gasping for 
    breath and regardless of logical connection in my words. I longed to have it 
    all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to begin. "Why 
    have you come? Answer, answer," I cried, hardly knowing what I was doing. 
    "I'll tell you, my good girl, why you have come. You've come because I 
    talked sentimental stuff to you then. So now you are soft as butter and 
    longing for fine sentiments again. So you may as well know that I was 
    laughing at you then. And I am laughing at you now. Why are you shuddering? 
    Yes, I was laughing at you! I had been insulted just before, at dinner, by 
    the fellows who came that evening before me. I came to you, meaning to 
    thrash one of them, an officer; but I didn't succeed, I didn't find him; I 
    had to avenge the insult on someone to get back my own again; you turned up, 
    I vented my spleen on you and laughed at you. I had been humiliated, so I 
    wanted to humiliate; I had been treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my 
    power.... hat's what it was, and you imagined I had come there on purpose to 
    save you. Yes? You imagined that? You imagined that?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in exactly, 
    but I knew, too, that she would grasp the gist of it, very well indeed. And 
    so, indeed, she did. She turned white as a handkerchief, tried to say 
    something, and her lips worked painfully; but she sank on a chair as though 
    she had been felled by an axe. And all the time afterwards she listened to 
    me with her lips parted and her eyes wide open, shuddering with awful 
    terror. The cynicism, the cynicism of my words overwhelmed her....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Save you!" I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down 
    the room before her. "Save you from what? But perhaps I am worse than you 
    myself. Why didn't you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you that 
    sermon: 'But what did you come here yourself for? was it to read us a 
    sermon?' Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I wanted, I 
    wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your hysteria每that was 
    what I wanted then! Of course, I couldn't keep it up then, because I am a 
    wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the devil knows why, gave you my 
    address in my folly. Afterwards, before I got home, I was cursing and 
    swearing at you because of that address, I hated you already because of the 
    lies I had told you. Because I only like playing with words, only dreaming, 
    but, do you know, what I really want is that you should all go to hell. That 
    is what I want. I want peace; yes, I'd sell the whole world for a farthing, 
    straight off, so long as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or 
    am I to go without my tea? I say that the world may go to pot for me so long 
    as I always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know that 
    I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been 
    shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your coming. And do you 
    know what has worried me particularly for these three days? That I posed as 
    such a hero to you, and now you would see me in a wretched torn 
    dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you just now that I was not 
    ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know that I am ashamed of it; I am 
    more ashamed of it than of anything, more afraid of it than of being found 
    out if I were a thief, because I am as vain as though I had been skinned and 
    the very air blowing on me hurt. Surely by now you must realise that I shall 
    never forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing-gown, just 
    as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful cur. The saviour, the former 
    hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey, and the 
    lackey was jeering at him! And I shall never forgive you for the tears I 
    could not help shedding before you just now, like some silly woman put to 
    shame! And for what I am confessing to you now, I shall never forgive you 
    either! Yes每you must answer for it all because you turned up like this, 
    because I am a blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest 
    and most envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I 
    am, but, the devil knows why, are never put to confusion; while I shall 
    always be insulted by every louse, that is my doom! And what is it to me 
    that you don't understand a word of this! And what do I care, what do I care 
    about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not? Do you understand? How I 
    shall hate you now after saying this, for having been here and listening. 
    Why, it's not once in a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is 
    in hysterics! ...What more do you want? Why do you still stand confronting 
    me, after all this? Why are you worrying me? Why don't you go?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But at this point a strange thing happened. I was so accustomed to think 
    and imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in the world to 
    myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand, that I could not 
    all at once take in this strange circumstance. What happened was this: Liza, 
    insulted and crushed by me, understood a great deal more than I imagined. 
    She understood from all this what a woman understands first of all, if she 
    feels genuine love, that is, that I was myself unhappy.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by a 
    look of sorrowful perplexity. When I began calling myself a scoundrel and a 
    blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was accompanied throughout by 
    tears) her whole face worked convulsively. She was on the point of getting 
    up and stopping me; when I finished she took no notice of my shouting: "Why 
    are you here, why don't you go away?" but realised only that it must have 
    been very bitter to me to say all this. Besides, she was so crushed, poor 
    girl; she considered herself infinitely beneath me; how could she feel anger 
    or resentment? She suddenly leapt up from her chair with an irresistible 
    impulse and held out her hands, yearning towards me, though still timid and 
    not daring to stir.... At this point there was a revulsion in my heart too. 
    Then she suddenly rushed to me, threw her arms round me and burst into 
    tears. I, too, could not restrain myself, and sobbed as I never had 
    before...</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"They won't let me...I can't be...good!" I managed to articulate; then I 
    went to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a quarter 
    of an hour in genuine hysterics. She came close to me, put her arms round me 
    and stayed motionless in that position. But the trouble was that the 
    hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the loathsome truth) 
    lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust into my nasty leather 
    pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a far-away, involuntary but 
    irresistible feeling that it would be awkward now for me to raise my head 
    and look Liza straight in the face. Why was I ashamed? I don't know, but I 
    was ashamed. The thought, too, came into my overwrought brain that our parts 
    now were completely changed, that she was now the heroine, while I was just 
    a crushed and humiliated creature as she had been before me that night每four 
    days before.... And all this came into my mind during the minutes I was 
    lying on my face on the sofa.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">My God! surely I was not envious of her then.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I don't know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course, I 
    was still less able to understand what I was feeling than now. I cannot get 
    on without domineering and tyrannising over someone, but ... there is no 
    explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so sooner or 
    later...and I am convinced to this day that it was just became I was ashamed 
    to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled and flamed up in my 
    heart...a feeling of mastery and possession. My eyes gleamed with passion, 
    and I gripped her hands tightly. How I hated her and how I was drawn to her 
    at that minute! The one feeling intensified the other. It was almost like an 
    act of vengeance. At first there was a look of amazement, even of terror on 
    her face, but only for one instant. She warmly and rapturously embraced 
    me.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">X</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">A quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in frenzied 
    impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and peeped through 
    the crack at Liza. She was sitting on the floor with her head leaning 
    against the bed, and must have been crying. But she did not go away, and 
    that irritated me. This time she understood it all. I had insulted her 
    finally, but...there's no need to describe it. She realised that my outburst 
    of passion had been simply revenge, a fresh humiliation, and that to my 
    earlier, almost causeless hatred was added now a <I>personal hatred,</I> 
    born of envy....Though I do not maintain positively that she understood all 
    this distinctly; but she certainly did fully understand that I was a 
    despicable man, and what was worse, incapable of loving her.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I know I shall be told that this is incredible每but it is incredible to be 
    as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange I 
    should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love. Why is it strange? 
    In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I repeat, with me 
    loving meant tyrannising and showing my moral superiority. I have never in 
    my life been able to imagine any other sort of love, and have nowadays come 
    to the point of sometimes thinking that love really consists in the 
    right每freely given by the beloved object每to tyrannise over her.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a 
    struggle. I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral subjugation, 
    and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated object. And what 
    is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in so corrupting 
    myself, since I was so out of touch with "real life," as to have actually 
    thought of reproaching her, and putting her to shame for having come to me 
    to hear "fine sentiments"; and did not even guess that she had come not to 
    hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because to a woman all reformation, 
    all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all moral renewal is included in 
    love and can only show itself in that form.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room 
    and peeping through the crack in the screen. I was only insufferably 
    oppressed by her being here. I wanted her to disappear. I wanted "peace," to 
    be left alone in my underground world. Real life oppressed me with its 
    novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as 
    though she were unconscious. I had the shamelessness to tap softly at the 
    screen as though to remind her....She started, sprang up, and flew to seek 
    her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her escape from me....Two 
    minutes later she came from behind the screen and looked with heavy eyes at 
    me. I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced, however, to <I>keep up 
    appearances,</I> and I turned away from her eyes.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Good-bye," she said, going towards the door.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and 
    closed it again. Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the other 
    corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I did mean a moment since to tell a lie每to write that I did this 
    accidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through 
    losing my head. But I don't want to lie, and so I will say straight out that 
    I opened her hand and put the money in it...from spite. It came into my head 
    to do this while I was running up and down the room and she was sitting 
    behind the screen. But this I can say for certain: though I did that cruel 
    thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the heart, but came from my evil 
    brain. This cruelty was so affected, so purposely made up, so completely a 
    product of the brain, of books, that I could not even keep it up a 
    minute每first I dashed away to avoid seeing her, and then in shame and 
    despair rushed after Liza. I opened the door in the passage and began 
    listening.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Liza! Liza!" I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">There was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on 
    the stairs.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Liza!" I cried, more loudly.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">No answer. But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open 
    heavily with a creak and slam violently; the sound echoed up the stairs.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">She had gone. I went back to my room in hesitation. I felt horribly 
    oppressed.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and 
    looked aimlessly before me. A minute passed, suddenly I started; straight 
    before me on the table I saw .... In short, I saw a crumpled blue 
    five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute before. It was 
    the same note; it could be no other, there was no other in the flat. So she 
    had managed to fling it from her hand on the table at the moment when I had 
    dashed into the further corner.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Well! I might have expected that she would do that. Might I have expected 
    it? No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for my 
    fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so. I could not 
    endure it. A minute later I flew like a madman to dress, flinging on what I 
    could at random and ran headlong after her. She could not have got two 
    hundred paces away when I ran out into the street.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling 
    almost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as though 
    with a pillow. There was no one in the street, no sound was to be heard. The 
    street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer. I ran two hundred 
    paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Where had she gone? And why was I running after her?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Why? To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to 
    entreat her forgiveness! I longed for that, my whole breast was being rent 
    to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with indifference. 
    But每what for? I thought. Should I not begin to hate her, perhaps, even 
    tomorrow, just because I had kissed her feet today? Should I give her 
    happiness? Had I not recognised that day, for the hundredth time, what I was 
    worth? Should I not torture her?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered 
    this.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"And will it not be better?" I mused fantastically, afterwards at home, 
    stifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams. "Will it not be 
    better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever? 
    Resentment每why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and painful 
    consciousness! Tomorrow I should have defiled her soul and have exhausted 
    her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in her heart, and 
    however loathsome the filth awaiting her每the feeling of insult will elevate 
    and purify her...by hatred...h'm!...perhaps, too, by forgiveness.... Will 
    all that make things easier for her though? ..."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which 
    is better每cheap happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">So I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain in 
    my soul. Never had I endured such suffering and remorse, yet could there 
    have been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that I should 
    turn back half-way? I never met Liza again and I have heard nothing of her. 
    I will add, too, that I remained for a long time afterwards pleased with the 
    phrase about the benefit from resentment and hatred in spite of the fact 
    that I almost fell ill from misery.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">. . . . .</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Even now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory. I 
    have many evil memories now, but...hadn't I better end my "Notes" here? I 
    believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I have felt 
    ashamed all the time I've been writing this story; so it's hardly literature 
    so much as a corrective punishment. Why, to tell long stories, showing how I 
    have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner, through lack of 
    fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite in 
    my underground world, would certainly not be interesting; a novel needs a 
    hero, and all the traits for an anti-hero are <I>expressly</I> gathered 
    together here, and what matters most, it all produces an unpleasant 
    impression, for we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples, every 
    one of us, more or less. We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a 
    sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. 
    Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as 
    hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books. And 
    why do we fuss and fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something 
    else? We don't know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our 
    petulant prayers were answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, 
    a little more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our 
    activity, relax the control and we...yes, I assure you...we should be 
    begging to be under control again at once. I know that you will very likely 
    be angry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping. Speak for 
    yourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your underground holes, and 
    don't dare to say all of us每excuse me, gentlemen, I am not justifying myself 
    with that "all of us." As for what concerns me in particular I have only in 
    my life carried to an extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and 
    what's more, you have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found 
    comfort in deceiving yourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more 
    life in me than in you. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don't even know 
    what living means now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us alone 
    without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We shall not 
    know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate, 
    what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men每men with 
    a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a 
    disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised man. 
    We are stillborn, and for generations past have been begotten, not by living 
    fathers, and that suits us better and better. We are developing a taste for 
    it. Soon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea. But enough; I 
    don't want to write more from "Underground"...</font></P>
