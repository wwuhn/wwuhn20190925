    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">I</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I am a sick man.... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I 
    believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my 
    disease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don't consult a doctor 
    for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and doctors. 
    Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine, 
    anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am 
    superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite. That you 
    probably will not understand. Well, I understand it, though. Of course, I 
    can't explain who it is precisely that I am mortifying in this case by my 
    spite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot "pay out" the doctors by not 
    consulting them; I know better than anyone that by all this I am only 
    injuring myself and no one else. But still, if I don't consult a doctor it 
    is from spite. My liver is bad, well每let it get worse!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I have been going on like that for a long time每twenty years. Now I am 
    forty. I used to be in the government service, but am no longer. I was a 
    spiteful official. I was rude and took pleasure in being so. I did not take 
    bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that, at least. (A 
    poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it thinking it would sound 
    very witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only wanted to show off 
    in a despicable way每I will not scratch it out on purpose!) When petitioners 
    used to come for information to the table at which I sat, I used to grind my 
    teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded in making anybody 
    unhappy. I almost did succeed. For the most part they were all timid 
    people每of course, they were petitioners. But of the uppish ones there was 
    one officer in particular I could not endure. He simply would not be humble, 
    and clanked his sword in a disgusting way. I carried on a feud with him for 
    eighteen months over that sword. At last I got the better of him. He left 
    off clanking it. That happened in my youth, though. But do you know, 
    gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite? Why, the whole point, 
    the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually, even in the moment of 
    the acutest spleen, I was inwardly conscious with shame that I was not only 
    not a spiteful but not even an embittered man, that I was simply scaring 
    sparrows at random and amusing myself by it. I might foam at the mouth, but 
    bring me a doll to play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and 
    maybe I should be appeased. I might even be genuinely touched, though 
    probably I should grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night 
    with shame for months after. That was my way.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official. I was 
    lying from spite. I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with 
    the officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful. I was conscious 
    every moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely opposite to 
    that. I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite elements. I knew 
    that they had been swarming in me all my life and craving some outlet from 
    me, but I would not let them, would not let them, purposely would not let 
    them come out. They tormented me till I was ashamed: they drove me to 
    convulsions and每sickened me, at last, how they sickened me! Now, are not you 
    fancying, gentlemen, that I am expressing remorse for something now, that I 
    am asking your forgiveness for something? I am sure you are fancying that 
    ... However, I assure you I do not care if you are....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to 
    become anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an honest 
    man, neither a hero nor an insect. Now, I am living out my life in my 
    corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an 
    intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool 
    who becomes anything. Yes, a man in the nineteenth century must and morally 
    ought to be pre-eminently a characterless creature; a man of character, an 
    active man is pre-eminently a limited creature. That is my conviction of 
    forty years. I am forty years old now, and you know forty years is a whole 
    lifetime; you know it is extreme old age. To live longer than forty years is 
    bad manners, is vulgar, immoral. Who does live beyond forty? Answer that, 
    sincerely and honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows. 
    I tell all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all 
    these silver-haired and reverend seniors! I tell the whole world that to its 
    face! I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to sixty myself. To 
    seventy! To eighty!... Stay, let me take breath ...</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you. You are 
    mistaken in that, too. I am by no means such a mirthful person as you 
    imagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble (and I 
    feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I am每then my answer 
    is, I am a collegiate assessor. I was in the service that I might have 
    something to eat (and solely for that reason), and when last year a distant 
    relation left me six thousand roubles in his will I immediately retired from 
    the service and settled down in my corner. I used to live in this corner 
    before, but now I have settled down in it. My room is a wretched, horrid one 
    in the outskirts of the town. My servant is an old country-woman, 
    ill-natured from stupidity, and, moreover, there is always a nasty smell 
    about her. I am told that the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that 
    with my small means it is very expensive to live in Petersburg. I know all 
    that better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and monitors.... 
    But I am remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg! I am 
    not going away because ... ech! Why, it is absolutely no matter whether I am 
    going away or not going away.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Answer: Of himself.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Well, so I will talk about myself.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">II</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not, 
    why I could not even become an insect. I tell you solemnly, that I have many 
    times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that. I swear, 
    gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness每a real thorough-going 
    illness. For man's everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to have 
    the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the amount 
    which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy nineteenth 
    century, especially one who has the fatal ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, 
    the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole terrestrial globe. 
    (There are intentional and unintentional towns.) It would have been quite 
    enough, for instance, to have the consciousness by which all so-called 
    direct persons and men of action live. I bet you think I am writing all this 
    from affectation, to be witty at the expense of men of action; and what is 
    more, that from ill-bred affectation, I am clanking a sword like my officer. 
    But, gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger 
    over them?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves on 
    their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone. We will not dispute it; 
    my contention was absurd. But yet I am firmly persuaded that a great deal of 
    consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a disease. I stick 
    to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me this: why does it 
    happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments when I am most capable of 
    feeling every refinement of all that is "sublime and beautiful," as they 
    used to say at one time, it would, as though of design, happen to me not 
    only to feel but to do such ugly things, such that ... Well, in short, 
    actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred 
    to me at the very time when I was most conscious that they ought not to be 
    committed. The more conscious I was of goodness and of all that was "sublime 
    and beautiful," the more deeply I sank into my mire and the more ready I was 
    to sink in it altogether. But the chief point was that all this was, as it 
    were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to be so. It was as 
    though it were my most normal condition, and not in the least disease or 
    depravity, so that at last all desire in me to struggle against this 
    depravity passed. It ended by my almost believing (perhaps actually 
    believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition. But at first, in the 
    beginning, what agonies I endured in that struggle! I did not believe it was 
    the same with other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as 
    a secret. I was ashamed (even now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the 
    point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in 
    returning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely 
    conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that what 
    was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at 
    myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness 
    turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last每into positive 
    real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I 
    have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other 
    people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the 
    too intense consciousness of one's own degradation; it was from feeling 
    oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but 
    that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you 
    never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still 
    left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish 
    to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because 
    perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into. And the worst 
    of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord with the normal 
    fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and with the inertia that was 
    the direct result of those laws, and that consequently one was not only 
    unable to change but could do absolutely nothing. Thus it would follow, as 
    the result of acute consciousness, that one is not to blame in being a 
    scoundrel; as though that were any consolation to the scoundrel once he has 
    come to realise that he actually is a scoundrel. But enough.... Ech, I have 
    talked a lot of nonsense, but what have I explained? How is enjoyment in 
    this to be explained? But I will explain it. I will get to the bottom of it! 
    That is why I have taken up my pen....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I, for instance, have a great deal of amour propre. I am as suspicious 
    and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf. But upon my word I 
    sometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be slapped in the face 
    I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it. I say, in earnest, that 
    I should probably have been able to discover even in that a peculiar sort of 
    enjoyment每the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but in despair there are the 
    most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of 
    the hopelessness of one's position. And when one is slapped in the face每why 
    then the consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively 
    overwhelm one. The worst of it is, look at it which way one will, it still 
    turns out that I was always the most to blame in everything. And what is 
    most humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say, 
    through the laws of nature. In the first place, to blame because I am 
    cleverer than any of the people surrounding me. (I have always considered 
    myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and sometimes, would 
    you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it. At any rate, I have all 
    my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never could look people 
    straight in the face.) To blame, finally, because even if I had had 
    magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering from the sense of its 
    uselessness. I should certainly have never been able to do anything from 
    being magnanimous每neither to forgive, for my assailant would perhaps have 
    slapped me from the laws of nature, and one cannot forgive the laws of 
    nature; nor to forget, for even if it were owing to the laws of nature, it 
    is insulting all the same. Finally, even if I had wanted to be anything but 
    magnanimous, had desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant, 
    I could not have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should 
    certainly never have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able 
    to. Why should I not have made up my mind? About that in particular I want 
    to say a few words.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">III</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for 
    themselves in general, how is it done? Why, when they are possessed, let us 
    suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is nothing else 
    but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a gentleman simply dashes 
    straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down, and 
    nothing but a wall will stop him. (By the way: facing the wall, such 
    gentlemen每that is, the "direct" persons and men of action每are genuinely 
    nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion, as for us people who think 
    and consequently do nothing; it is not an excuse for turning aside, an 
    excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe in it 
    ourselves, as a rule. No, they are nonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has 
    for them something tranquillising, morally soothing, final, maybe even 
    something mysterious ... but of the wall later.) Well, such a direct person 
    I regard as the real normal man, as his tender mother nature wished to see 
    him when she graciously brought him into being on the earth. I envy such a 
    man till I am green in the face. He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but 
    perhaps the normal man should be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very 
    beautiful, in fact. And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one 
    can call it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis 
    of the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of 
    course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is almost 
    mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made man is 
    sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that with all his 
    exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and not 
    a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the 
    other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et caetera. And the worst of it 
    is, he himself, his very own self, looks on himself as a mouse; no one asks 
    him to do so; and that is an important point. </font> </P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Now let us look at this mouse in action. Let us suppose, for instance, 
    that it feels insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and 
    wants to revenge itself, too. There may even be a greater accumulation of 
    spite in it than in l'homme de la nature et de la verite. The base and nasty 
    desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily 
    in it than in l'homme de la nature et de la verite. For through his innate 
    stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; 
    while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe 
    in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed itself, to the very act of 
    revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless mouse 
    succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of 
    doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many unsettled questions 
    that there inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking 
    mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the contempt spat upon it by 
    the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and 
    arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides ache. Of course the 
    only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, 
    with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe, 
    creep ignominiously into its mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, 
    underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes 
    absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty 
    years together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most 
    ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still more 
    ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own 
    imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will 
    recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will invent unheard 
    of things against itself, pretending that those things might happen, and 
    will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too, but, as it 
    were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the stove, incognito, without 
    believing either in its own right to vengeance, or in the success of its 
    revenge, knowing that from all its efforts at revenge it will suffer a 
    hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, 
    will not even scratch himself. On its deathbed it will recall it all over 
    again, with interest accumulated over all the years and ... But it is just 
    in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that conscious 
    burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years, in that 
    acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of one's position, 
    in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of 
    oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a 
    minute later每that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have 
    spoken lies. It is so subtle, so difficult of analysis, that persons who are 
    a little limited, or even simply persons of strong nerves, will not 
    understand a single atom of it. "Possibly," you will add on your own account 
    with a grin, "people will not understand it either who have never received a 
    slap in the face," and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, 
    perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I 
    speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set your minds 
    at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face, though it is 
    absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it. 
    Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so few slaps in the face 
    during my life. But enough ... not another word on that subject of such 
    extreme interest to you.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not 
    understand a certain refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain 
    circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though this, 
    let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have said already, 
    confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The impossible means 
    the stone wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the laws of nature, the 
    deductions of natural science, mathematics. As soon as they prove to you, 
    for instance, that you are descended from a monkey, then it is no use 
    scowling, accept it for a fact. When they prove to you that in reality one 
    drop of your own fat must be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your 
    fellow-creatures, and that this conclusion is the final solution of all 
    so-called virtues and duties and all such prejudices and fancies, then you 
    have just to accept it, there is no help for it, for twice two is a law of 
    mathematics. Just try refuting it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Upon my word," they will shout at you, "it is no use protesting: it is a 
    case of twice two makes four! Nature does not ask your permission, she has 
    nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or dislike 
    them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently all her 
    conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so on." Merciful 
    Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, for 
    some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four? Of 
    course I cannot break through the wall by battering my head against it if I 
    really have not the strength to knock it down, but I am not going to be 
    reconciled to it simply because it is a stone wall and I have not the 
    strength.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">As though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did 
    contain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as twice two 
    makes four. Oh, absurdity of absurdities! How much better it is to 
    understand it all, to recognise it all, all the impossibilities and the 
    stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those impossibilities and stone 
    walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to it; by the way of the most 
    inevitable, logical combinations to reach the most revolting conclusions on 
    the everlasting theme, that even for the stone wall you are yourself somehow 
    to blame, though again it is as clear as day you are not to blame in the 
    least, and therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into 
    luxurious inertia, brooding on the fact that there is no one even for you to 
    feel vindictive against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an 
    object for your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a 
    card- sharper's trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing what and no 
    knowing who, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings, still 
    there is an ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse the 
    ache.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">IV</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Ha, ha, ha! You will be finding enjoyment in toothache next," you cry, 
    with a laugh.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Well, even in toothache there is enjoyment," I answer. I had toothache 
    for a whole month and I know there is. In that case, of course, people are 
    not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not candid moans, they are 
    malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point. The enjoyment of the 
    sufferer finds expression in those moans; if he did not feel enjoyment in 
    them he would not moan. It is a good example, gentlemen, and I will develop 
    it. Those moans express in the first place all the aimlessness of your pain, 
    which is so humiliating to your consciousness; the whole legal system of 
    nature on which you spit disdainfully, of course, but from which you suffer 
    all the same while she does not. They express the consciousness that you 
    have no enemy to punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in 
    spite of all possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; 
    that if someone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does 
    not, they will go on aching another three months; and that finally if you 
    are still contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for your own 
    gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with your fist as hard 
    as you can, and absolutely nothing more. Well, these mortal insults, these 
    jeers on the part of someone unknown, end at last in an enjoyment which 
    sometimes reaches the highest degree of voluptuousness. I ask you, 
    gentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans of an educated man of the 
    nineteenth century suffering from toothache, on the second or third day of 
    the attack, when he is beginning to moan, not as he moaned on the first day, 
    that is, not simply because he has toothache, not just as any coarse 
    peasant, but as a man affected by progress and European civilisation, a man 
    who is "divorced from the soil and the national elements," as they express 
    it now-a-days. His moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for 
    whole days and nights. And of course he knows himself that he is doing 
    himself no sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he 
    is only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows 
    that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his whole 
    family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha'porth of faith in him, 
    and inwardly understand that he might moan differently, more simply, without 
    trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing himself like that from 
    ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these recognitions and disgraces 
    it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure. As though he would say: "I am 
    worrying you, I am lacerating your hearts, I am keeping everyone in the 
    house awake. Well, stay awake then, you, too, feel every minute that I have 
    toothache. I am not a hero to you now, as I tried to seem before, but simply 
    a nasty person, an impostor. Well, so be it, then! I am very glad that you 
    see through me. It is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let 
    it be nasty; here I will let you have a nastier flourish in a minute...." 
    You do not understand even now, gentlemen? No, it seems our development and 
    our consciousness must go further to understand all the intricacies of this 
    pleasure. You laugh? Delighted. My jests, gentlemen, are of course in bad 
    taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence. But of course that is 
    because I do not respect myself. Can a man of perception respect himself at 
    all?</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">V</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Come, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of his 
    own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself? I am not 
    saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse. And, indeed, I could never 
    endure saying, "Forgive me, Papa, I won't do it again," not because I am 
    incapable of saying that每on the contrary, perhaps just because I have been 
    too capable of it, and in what a way, too. As though of design I used to get 
    into trouble in cases when I was not to blame in any way. That was the 
    nastiest part of it. At the same time I was genuinely touched and penitent, 
    I used to shed tears and, of course, deceived myself, though I was not 
    acting in the least and there was a sick feeling in my heart at the time.... 
    For that one could not blame even the laws of nature, though the laws of 
    nature have continually all my life offended me more than anything. It is 
    loathsome to remember it all, but it was loathsome even then. Of course, a 
    minute or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was all a lie, a 
    revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this emotion, 
    these vows of reform. You will ask why did I worry myself with such antics: 
    answer, because it was very dull to sit with one's hands folded, and so one 
    began cutting capers. That is really it. Observe yourselves more carefully, 
    gentlemen, then you will understand that it is so. I invented adventures for 
    myself and made up a life, so as at least to live in some way. How many 
    times it has happened to me每well, for instance, to take offence simply on 
    purpose, for nothing; and one knows oneself, of course, that one is offended 
    at nothing; that one is putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last to 
    the point of being really offended. All my life I have had an impulse to 
    play such pranks, so that in the end I could not control it in myself. 
    Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, 
    gentlemen, I assure you. In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my 
    suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in the 
    real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself ... and it was all from 
    ennui, gentlemen, all from ennui; inertia overcame me. You know the direct, 
    legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious 
    sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this already. I repeat, I 
    repeat with emphasis: all "direct" persons and men of action are active just 
    because they are stupid and limited. How explain that? I will tell you: in 
    consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for 
    primary ones, and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily 
    than other people do that they have found an infallible foundation for their 
    activity, and their minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. 
    To begin to act, you know, you must first have your mind completely at ease 
    and no trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example to set my mind 
    at rest? Where are the primary causes on which I am to build? Where are my 
    foundations? Where am I to get them from? I exercise myself in reflection, 
    and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws after itself 
    another still more primary, and so on to infinity. That is just the essence 
    of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must be a case of the laws 
    of nature again. What is the result of it in the end? Why, just the same. 
    Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am sure you did not take it in.) 
    I said that a man revenges himself because he sees justice in it. Therefore 
    he has found a primary cause, that is, justice. And so he is at rest on all 
    sides, and consequently he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully, 
    being persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing. But I see no 
    justice in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I 
    attempt to revenge myself, it is only out of spite. Spite, of course, might 
    overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve quite successfully in 
    place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a cause. But what is 
    to be done if I have not even spite (I began with that just now, you know). 
    In consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me is 
    subject to chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object flies off 
    into air, your reasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong 
    becomes not a wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which 
    no one is to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left 
    again每that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up with a 
    wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause. And try 
    letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly, without 
    reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at least for a 
    time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands folded. The day after 
    tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin despising yourself for having 
    knowingly deceived yourself. Result: a soap-bubble and inertia. Oh, 
    gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only 
    because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish 
    anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of 
    us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every 
    intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through 
    a sieve?</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">VI</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should 
    have respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I should 
    at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least have been one 
    quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could have believed myself. 
    Question: What is he? Answer: A sluggard; how very pleasant it would have 
    been to hear that of oneself! It would mean that I was positively defined, 
    it would mean that there was something to say about me. "Sluggard"每why, it 
    is a calling and vocation, it is a career. Do not jest, it is so. I should 
    then be a member of the best club by right, and should find my occupation in 
    continually respecting myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his 
    life on being a connoisseur of Lafitte. He considered this as his positive 
    virtue, and never doubted himself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but 
    with a triumphant conscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should 
    have chosen a career for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a 
    glutton, not a simple one, but, for instance, one with sympathies for 
    everything sublime and beautiful. How do you like that? I have long had 
    visions of it. That "sublime and beautiful" weighs heavily on my mind at 
    forty But that is at forty; then每oh, then it would have been different! I 
    should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be 
    precise, drinking to the health of everything "sublime and beautiful." I 
    should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and 
    then to drain it to all that is "sublime and beautiful." I should then have 
    turned everything into the sublime and the beautiful; in the nastiest, 
    unquestionable trash, I should have sought out the sublime and the 
    beautiful. I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge. An artist, for 
    instance, paints a picture worthy of Gay. At once I drink to the health of 
    the artist who painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is 
    "sublime and beautiful." An author has written "As you will"; at once I 
    drink to the health of "anyone you will" because I love all that is "sublime 
    and beautiful." I should claim respect for doing so. I should persecute 
    anyone who would not show me respect. I should live at ease, I should die 
    with dignity, why, it is charming, perfectly charming! And what a good round 
    belly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have established, 
    what a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so that everyone would 
    have said, looking at me: "Here is an asset! Here is something real and 
    solid!" And, say what you like, it is very agreeable to hear such remarks 
    about oneself in this negative age.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">VII</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But these are all golden dreams. Oh, tell me, who was it first announced, 
    who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things because he does 
    not know his own interests; and that if he were enlightened, if his eyes 
    were opened to his real normal interests, man would at once cease to do 
    nasty things, would at once become good and noble because, being enlightened 
    and understanding his real advantage, he would see his own advantage in the 
    good and nothing else, and we all know that not one man can, consciously, 
    act against his own interests, consequently, so to say, through necessity, 
    he would begin doing good? Oh, the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, 
    in the first place, when in all these thousands of years has there been a 
    time when man has acted only from his own interest? What is to be done with 
    the millions of facts that bear witness that men, <I>consciously,</I> that 
    is fully understanding their real interests, have left them in the 
    background and have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and 
    danger, compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were, 
    simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck 
    out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness. So, I 
    suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any 
    advantage.... Advantage! What is advantage? And will you take it upon 
    yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the advantage of man 
    consists? And what if it so happens that a man's advantage, 
    <I>sometimes,</I> not only may, but even must, consist in his desiring in 
    certain cases what is harmful to himself and not advantageous. And if so, if 
    there can be such a case, the whole principle falls into dust. What do you 
    think每are there such cases? You laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only 
    answer me: have man's advantages been reckoned up with perfect certainty? 
    Are there not some which not only have not been included but cannot possibly 
    be included under any classification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the 
    best of my knowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the 
    averages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas. Your 
    advantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace每and so on, and so on. So 
    that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in opposition 
    to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine, too, of course, be 
    an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he? But, you know, this is 
    what is surprising: why does it so happen that all these statisticians, 
    sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon up human advantages 
    invariably leave out one? They don't even take it into their reckoning in 
    the form in which it should be taken, and the whole reckoning depends upon 
    that. It would be no greater matter, they would simply have to take it, this 
    advantage, and add it to the list. But the trouble is, that this strange 
    advantage does not fall under any classification and is not in place in any 
    list. I have a friend for instance ... Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is 
    your friend, too; and indeed there is no one, no one to whom he is not a 
    friend! When he prepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately 
    explains to you, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in 
    accordance with the laws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to 
    you with excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with 
    irony he will upbraid the short- sighted fools who do not understand their 
    own interests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter of 
    an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through 
    something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will go 
    off on quite a different tack每that is, act in direct opposition to what he 
    has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws of reason, in 
    opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to everything ... I 
    warn you that my friend is a compound personality and therefore it is 
    difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is, gentlemen, it seems 
    there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than 
    his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most 
    advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) 
    which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for 
    the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all 
    laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity每in fact, 
    in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain 
    that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than 
    all. "Yes, but it's advantage all the same," you will retort. But excuse me, 
    I'll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What 
    matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it 
    breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system 
    constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it 
    upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I want to 
    compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these 
    fine systems, all these theories for explaining to mankind their real normal 
    interests, in order that inevitably striving to pursue these interests they 
    may at once become good and noble每are, in my opinion, so far, mere logical 
    exercises! Yes, logical exercises. Why, to maintain this theory of the 
    regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to 
    my mind almost the same thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following 
    Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently 
    less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to 
    follow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and 
    abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he 
    is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I 
    take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look 
    about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as 
    though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which 
    Buckle lived. Take Napoleon每the Great and also the present one. Take North 
    America每the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein... . And 
    what is it that civilisation softens in us? The only gain of civilisation 
    for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations每and absolutely 
    nothing more. And through the development of this many- sidedness man may 
    come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened 
    to him. Have you noticed that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have 
    been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could 
    not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and 
    Stenka Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so 
    ordinary and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has 
    made mankind if not more blood-thirsty, at least more vilely, more 
    loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with 
    his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do 
    think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with 
    more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say 
    that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking 
    gold pins into her slave-girls' breasts and derived gratification from their 
    screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the comparatively 
    barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too, because also, 
    comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that though man has now 
    learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages, he is still far from 
    having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate. But yet you are 
    fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain 
    old bad habits, and when common sense and science have completely re- 
    educated human nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident 
    that then man will cease from <I>intentional</I> error and will, so to say, 
    be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. That 
    is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my mind 
    it's a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will 
    of his own, and that he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or 
    the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws of 
    nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is 
    done of itself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover 
    these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions 
    and life will become exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, 
    of course, be tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables 
    of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still, 
    there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of 
    encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly calculated 
    and explained that there will be no more incidents or adventures in the 
    world.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Then每this is all what you say每new economic relations will be established, 
    all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude, so that every 
    possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye, simply because 
    every possible answer to it will be provided. Then the "Palace of Crystal" 
    will be built. Then ... In fact, those will be halcyon days. Of course there 
    is no guaranteeing (this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, 
    frightfully dull then (for what will one have to do when everything will be 
    calculated and tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be 
    extraordinarily rational. Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is 
    boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not 
    matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say people 
    will be thankful for the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you know, 
    phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all stupid, but he is so 
    ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation. I, for 
    instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden, a propos 
    of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, 
    or rather with a reactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, 
    putting his arms akimbo, say to us all: "I say, gentleman, hadn't we better 
    kick over the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to 
    send these logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more at 
    our own sweet foolish will!" That again would not matter, but what is 
    annoying is that he would be sure to find followers每such is the nature of 
    man. And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was 
    hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, 
    whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as 
    his reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to 
    one's own interests, and sometimes one <I>positively ought</I> (that is my 
    idea). One's own free unfettered choice, one's own caprice, however wild it 
    may be, one's own fancy worked up at times to frenzy每is that very "most 
    advantageous advantage" which we have overlooked, which comes under no 
    classification and against which all systems and theories are continually 
    being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a 
    normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must want a 
    rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply <I>independent</I> 
    choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And 
    choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">VIII</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Ha! ha! ha! But you know there is no such thing as choice in reality, 
    say what you like," you will interpose with a chuckle. "Science has 
    succeeded in so far analysing man that we know already that choice and what 
    is called freedom of will is nothing else than每"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was 
    rather frightened. I was just going to say that the devil only knows what 
    choice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing, but I 
    remembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up. And here you 
    have begun upon it. Indeed, if there really is some day discovered a formula 
    for all our desires and caprices每that is, an explanation of what they depend 
    upon, by what laws they arise, how they develop, what they are aiming at in 
    one case and in another and so on, that is a real mathematical formula每then, 
    most likely, man will at once cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be 
    certain to. For who would want to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once 
    be transformed from a human being into an organ-stop or something of the 
    sort; for what is a man without desires, without free will and without 
    choice, if not a stop in an organ? What do you think? Let us reckon the 
    chances每can such a thing happen or not?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"H'm!" you decide. "Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of 
    our advantage. We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our 
    foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a 
    supposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked out on paper 
    (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and senseless to 
    suppose that some laws of nature man will never understand), then certainly 
    so-called desires will no longer exist. For if a desire should come into 
    conflict with reason we shall then reason and not desire, because it will be 
    impossible retaining our reason to be <I>senseless</I> in our desires, and 
    in that way knowingly act against reason and desire to injure ourselves. And 
    as all choice and reasoning can be really calculated每because there will some 
    day be discovered the laws of our so-called free will每so, joking apart, 
    there may one day be something like a table constructed of them, so that we 
    really shall choose in accordance with it. If, for instance, some day they 
    calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone because I could 
    not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that 
    particular way, what <I>freedom</I> is left me, especially if I am a learned 
    man and have taken my degree somewhere? Then I should be able to calculate 
    my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this could be 
    arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should have to 
    understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to repeat to ourselves 
    that at such and such a time and in such and such circumstances nature does 
    not ask our leave; that we have got to take her as she is and not fashion 
    her to suit our fancy, and if we really aspire to formulas and tables of 
    rules, and well, even ... to the chemical retort, there's no help for it, we 
    must accept the retort too, or else it will be accepted without our consent 
    ...."</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Yes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being 
    over-philosophical; it's the result of forty years underground! Allow me to 
    indulge my fancy. You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there's 
    no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the 
    rational side of man's nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole 
    life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the 
    impulses. And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often 
    worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots. Here I, 
    for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my 
    capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not 
    simply one twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason 
    only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will 
    never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human 
    nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or 
    unconsciously, and, even it if goes wrong, it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, 
    that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me again that an 
    enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future man will be, 
    cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself, that that can 
    be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree, it can每by mathematics. But I 
    repeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when man may 
    consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, 
    very stupid每simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even 
    what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what 
    is sensible. Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be 
    in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, 
    especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more advantageous 
    than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the 
    soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage每for in any 
    circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most 
    important每that is, our personality, our individuality. Some, you see, 
    maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice 
    can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially 
    if this be not abused but kept within bounds. It is profitable and some- 
    times even praiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is 
    utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know 
    that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let 
    us suppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose 
    that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who 
    is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! 
    Phenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man 
    is the ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect; 
    his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual每from the days 
    of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period. Moral obliquity and 
    consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that lack of 
    good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put it to the test 
    and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What will you see? Is it a 
    grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for 
    instance, that's worth something. With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of 
    it that some say that it is the work of man's hands, while others maintain 
    that it has been created by nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it 
    is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and 
    civilian, of all peoples in all ages每that alone is worth something, and if 
    you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no 
    historian would be equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it's 
    monotonous too: it's fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they 
    fought first and they fought last每you will admit, that it is almost too 
    monotonous. In short, one may say anything about the history of the 
    world每anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only 
    thing one can't say is that it's rational. The very word sticks in one's 
    throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: 
    there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages 
    and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as 
    morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their 
    neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally 
    and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people 
    sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, 
    often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since 
    he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly 
    blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of 
    bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he 
    should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with 
    the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, 
    sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his 
    cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most 
    uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good 
    sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his 
    vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to 
    himself每as though that were so necessary每that men still are men and not the 
    keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely 
    that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that 
    is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this 
    were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would 
    not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of 
    simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means 
    he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all 
    sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as 
    only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him 
    and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object每that 
    is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that 
    all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated每chaos and darkness and 
    curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would 
    stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go 
    mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it, I 
    answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing 
    but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It 
    may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, 
    can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that 
    desire still depends on something we don't know?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one 
    is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will 
    should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal 
    interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to 
    tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make 
    four? Twice two makes four without my will. As if free will meant that!</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">IX</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Gentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not 
    brilliant,but you know one can take everything as a joke. I am, perhaps, 
    jesting against the grain. Gentlemen, I am tormented by questions; answer 
    them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of their old habits and 
    reform their will in accordance with science and good sense. But how do you 
    know, not only that it is possible, but also that it is <I>desirable</I> to 
    reform man in that way? And what leads you to the conclusion that man's 
    inclinations <I>need</I> reforming? In short, how do you know that such a 
    reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go to the root of the matter, 
    why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal 
    interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is 
    certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind? 
    So far, you know, this is only your supposition. It may be the law of logic, 
    but not the law of humanity. You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad? 
    Allow me to defend myself. I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative 
    animal, predestined to strive consciously for an object and to engage in 
    engineering每that is, incessantly and eternally to make new roads, 
    <I>wherever they may lead</I>. But the reason why he wants sometimes to go 
    off at a tangent may just be that he is <I>predestined</I> to make the road, 
    and perhaps, too, that however stupid the "direct" practical man may be, the 
    thought sometimes will occur to him that the road almost always does lead 
    <I>somewhere,</I> and that the destination it leads to is less important 
    than the process of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the 
    well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the 
    fatal idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man 
    likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But why 
    has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also? Tell me that! 
    But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself. May it not be that 
    he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that he does 
    sometimes love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining his 
    object and completing the edifice he is constructing? Who knows, perhaps he 
    only loves that edifice from a distance, and is by no means in love with it 
    at close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does not want to 
    live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use of les animaux 
    domestiques每such as the ants, the sheep, and so on. Now the ants have quite 
    a different taste. They have a marvellous edifice of that pattern which 
    endures for ever每the ant-heap.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the 
    ant-heap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to their 
    perseverance and good sense. But man is a frivolous and incongruous 
    creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the game, 
    not the end of it. And who knows (there is no saying with certainty), 
    perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this 
    incessant process of attaining, in other words, in life itself, and not in 
    the thing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a formula, as 
    positive as twice two makes four, and such positiveness is not life, 
    gentlemen, but is the beginning of death. Anyway, man has always been afraid 
    of this mathematical certainty, and I am afraid of it now. Granted that man 
    does nothing but seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, 
    sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it, dreads, 
    I assure you. He feels that when he has found it there will be nothing for 
    him to look for. When workmen have finished their work they do at least 
    receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the 
    police-station每and there is occupation for a week. But where can man go? 
    Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has attained 
    such objects. He loves the process of attaining, but does not quite like to 
    have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In fact, man is a 
    comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it all. But yet 
    mathematical certainty is after all, something insufferable. Twice two makes 
    four seems to me simply a piece of insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert 
    coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit 
    that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give 
    everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing 
    too.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the 
    normal and the positive每in other words, only what is conducive to welfare每is 
    for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards advantage? Does 
    not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being? Perhaps he is just as 
    fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as 
    well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with 
    suffering, and that is a fact. There is no need to appeal to universal 
    history to prove that; only ask yourself, if you are a man and have lived at 
    all. As far as my personal opinion is concerned, to care only for well-being 
    seems to me positively ill-bred. Whether it's good or bad, it is sometimes 
    very pleasant, too, to smash things. I hold no brief for suffering nor for 
    well-being either. I am standing for ... my caprice, and for its being 
    guaranteed to me when necessary. Suffering would be out of place in 
    vaudevilles, for instance; I know that. In the "Palace of Crystal" it is 
    unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the good of 
    a "palace of crystal" if there could be any doubt about it? And yet I think 
    man will never renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Why, 
    suffering is the sole origin of consciousness. Though I did lay it down at 
    the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man, yet I 
    know man prizes it and would not give it up for any satisfaction. 
    Consciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four. 
    Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to 
    understand. There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five senses and 
    plunge into contemplation. While if you stick to consciousness, even though 
    the same result is attained, you can at least flog yourself at times, and 
    that will, at any rate, liven you up. Reactionary as it is, corporal 
    punishment is better than nothing.</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">X</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed每a palace 
    at which one will not be able to put out one's tongue or make a long nose on 
    the sly. And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this edifice, that it 
    is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one cannot put one's 
    tongue out at it even on the sly.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into it 
    to avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a palace out of 
    gratitude to it for keeping me dry. You laugh and say that in such 
    circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion. Yes, I answer, if one had 
    to live simply to keep out of the rain.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not 
    the only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live in a 
    mansion? That is my choice, my desire. You will only eradicate it when you 
    have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me with something 
    else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a hen-house for a 
    mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it may be that it is 
    inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have invented it only 
    through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned irrational habits of my 
    generation. But what does it matter to me that it is inconsistent? That 
    makes no difference since it exists in my desires, or rather exists as long 
    as my desires exist. Perhaps you are laughing again? Laugh away; I will put 
    up with any mockery rather than pretend that I am satisfied when I am 
    hungry. I know, anyway, that I will not be put off with a compromise, with a 
    recurring zero, simply because it is consistent with the laws of nature and 
    actually exists. I will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of 
    buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and 
    perhaps with a sign-board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy my desires, 
    eradicate my ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you. You 
    will say, perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in that case I can 
    give you the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you 
    won't deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I can 
    retreat into my underground hole.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were 
    withered off than bring one brick to such a building! Don't remind me that I 
    have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that one cannot 
    put out one's tongue at it. I did not say because I am so fond of putting my 
    tongue out. Perhaps the thing I resented was, that of all your edifices 
    there has not been one at which one could not put out one's tongue. On the 
    contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off out of gratitude if things could 
    be so arranged that I should lose all desire to put it out. It is not my 
    fault that things cannot be so arranged, and that one must be satisfied with 
    model flats. Then why am I made with such desires? Can I have been 
    constructed simply in order to come to the conclusion that all my 
    construction is a cheat? Can this be my whole purpose? I do not believe 
    it.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to be 
    kept on a curb. Though we may sit forty years underground without speaking, 
    when we do come out into the light of day and break out we talk and talk and 
    talk....</font></P>
    <H3><font face="Times New Roman">XI</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">The long and the short of it is, gentlemen, that it is better to do 
    nothing! Better conscious inertia! And so hurrah for underground! Though I 
    have said that I envy the normal man to the last drop of my bile, yet I 
    should not care to be in his place such as he is now (though I shall not 
    cease envying him). No, no; anyway the underground life is more 
    advantageous. There, at any rate, one can ... Oh, but even now I am lying! I 
    am lying because I know myself that it is not underground that is better, 
    but something different, quite different, for which I am thirsting, but 
    which I cannot find! Damn underground!</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I will tell you another thing that would be better, and that is, if I 
    myself believed in anything of what I have just written. I swear to you, 
    gentle- men, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have written 
    that I really believe. That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at the same time 
    I feel and suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Then why have you written all this?" you will say to me. "I ought to put 
    you underground for forty years without anything to do and then come to you 
    in your cellar, to find out what stage you have reached! How can a man be 
    left with nothing to do for forty years?"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Isn't that shameful, isn't that humiliating?" you will say, perhaps, 
    wagging your heads contemptuously. "You thirst for life and try to settle 
    the problems of life by a logical tangle. And how persistent, how insolent 
    are your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you are in! You talk 
    nonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent things and are in 
    continual alarm and apologising for them. You declare that you are afraid of 
    nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself in our good opinion. 
    You declare that you are gnashing your teeth and at the same time you try to 
    be witty so as to amuse us. You know that your witticisms are not witty, but 
    you are evidently well satisfied with their literary value. You may, 
    perhaps, have really suffered, but you have no respect for your own 
    suffering. You may have sincerity, but you have no modesty; out of the 
    pettiest vanity you expose your sincerity to publicity and ignominy. You 
    doubtlessly mean to say something, but hide your last word through fear, 
    because you have not the resolution to utter it, and only have a cowardly 
    impudence. You boast of consciousness, but you are not sure of your ground, 
    for though your mind works, yet your heart is darkened and corrupt, and you 
    cannot have a full, genuine consciousness without a pure heart. And how 
    intrusive you are, how you insist and grimace! Lies, lies, lies!"</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Of course I have myself made up all the things you say. That, too, is 
    from underground. I have been for forty years listening to you through a 
    crack under the floor. I have invented them myself, there was nothing else I 
    could invent. It is no wonder that I have learned it by heart and it has 
    taken a literary form....</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all this 
    and give it to you to read too? And another problem: why do I call you 
    "gentlemen," why do I address you as though you really were my readers? Such 
    confessions as I intend to make are never printed nor given to other people 
    to read. Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough for that, and I don't see why 
    I should be. But you see a fancy has occurred to me and I want to realise it 
    at all costs. Let me explain.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but only 
    to his friends. He has other matters in his mind which he would not reveal 
    even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. But there are 
    other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself, and every decent 
    man has a number of such things stored away in his mind. The more decent he 
    is, the greater the number of such things in his mind. Anyway, I have only 
    lately determined to remember some of my early adventures. Till now I have 
    always avoided them, even with a certain uneasiness. Now, when I am not only 
    recalling them, but have actually decided to write an account of them, I 
    want to try the experiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly 
    open and not take fright at the whole truth. I will observe, in parenthesis, 
    that Heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility, and 
    that man is bound to lie about himself. He considers that Rousseau certainly 
    told lies about himself in his confessions, and even intentionally lied, out 
    of vanity. I am convinced that Heine is right; I quite understand how 
    sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity, attribute regular crimes to oneself, 
    and indeed I can very well conceive that kind of vanity. But Heine judged of 
    people who made their confessions to the public. I write only for myself, 
    and I wish to declare once and for all that if I write as though I were 
    addressing readers, that is simply because it is easier for me to write in 
    that form. It is a form, an empty form每I shall never have readers. I have 
    made this plain already ...</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">I don't wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of my 
    notes. I shall not attempt any system or method. I will jot things down as I 
    remember them.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">But here, perhaps, someone will catch at the word and ask me: if you 
    really don't reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with 
    yourself每and on paper too每that is, that you won't attempt any system or 
    method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on, and so on? 
    Why are you explaining? Why do you apologise?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">"Well, there it is," I answer.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">There is a whole psychology in all this, though. Perhaps it is simply 
    that I am a coward. And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience before 
    me in order that I may be more dignified while I write. There are perhaps 
    thousands of reasons. Again, what is my object precisely in writing? If it 
    is not for the benefit of the public why should I not simply recall these 
    incidents in my own mind without putting them on paper?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Quite so; but yet it is more imposing on paper. There is something more 
    impressive in it; I shall be better able to criticise myself and improve my 
    style. Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from writing. Today, 
    for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory of a distant past. 
    It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and has remained haunting me 
    like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of. And yet I must get rid of 
    it somehow. I have hundreds of such reminiscences; but at times some one 
    stands out from the hundred and oppresses me. For some reason I believe that 
    if I write it down I should get rid of it. Why not try?</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Besides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do. Writing will be a 
    sort of work. They say work makes man kind-hearted and honest. Well, here is 
    a chance for me, anyway.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Times New Roman">Snow is falling today, yellow and dingy. It fell yesterday, too, and a 
    few days ago. I fancy it is the wet snow that has reminded me of that 
    incident which I cannot shake off now. And so let it be a story a propos of 
    the falling snow.</font></P>
