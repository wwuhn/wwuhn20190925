I waited a minute; then I spoke.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"Well?" I said.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">He turned, slowly, and looked at me. His thoughts seemed to have gone out of him into a great distance.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"Was he mad?" I asked, and indicated the MS., with a half nod.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">Tonnison stared at me, unseeingly, a moment; then, his wits came back to him, and, suddenly, he comprehended my question.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"No!" he said.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">I opened my lips, to offer a contradictory opinion; for my sense of the saneness of things, would not allow me to take the story literally; then I shut them again, without saying anything. Somehow, the certainty in Tonnison's voice affected my doubts. I felt, all at once, less assured; though I was by no means convinced as yet.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">After a few moments' silence, Tonnison rose, stiffly, and began to undress. He seemed disinclined to talk; so I said nothing; but followed his example. I was weary; though still full of the story I had just read.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">Somehow, as I rolled into my blankets, there crept into my mind a memory of the old gardens, as we had seen them. I remembered the odd fear that the place had conjured up in our hearts; and it grew upon me, with conviction, that Tonnison was right.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">It was very late when we rose--nearly midday; for the greater part of the night had been spent in reading the MS.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">Tonnison was grumpy, and I felt out of sorts. It was a somewhat dismal day, and there was a touch of chilliness in the air. There was no mention of going out fishing on either of our parts. We got dinner, and, after that, just sat and smoked in silence.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">Presently, Tonnison asked for the Manuscript: I handed it to him, and he spent most of the afternoon in reading it through by himself.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">It was while he was thus employed, that a thought came to me:--</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"What do you say to having another look at--?" I nodded my head down stream.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">Tonnison looked up. "Nothing!" he said, abruptly; and, somehow, I was less annoyed, than relieved, at his answer.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">After that, I left him alone.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">A little before tea-time, he looked up at me, curiously.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"Sorry, old chap, if I was a bit short with you just now;" (just now, indeed! he had not spoken for the last three hours) "but I would not go there again," and he indicated with his head, "for anything that you could offer me. Ugh!" and he put down that history of a man's terror and hope and despair.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">The next morning, we rose early, and went for our accustomed swim: we had partly shaken off the depression of the previous day; and so, took our rods when we had finished breakfast, and spent the day at our favourite sport.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">After that day, we enjoyed our holiday to the utmost; though both of us looked forward to the time when our driver should come; for we were tremendously anxious to inquire of him, and through him among the people of the tiny hamlet, whether any of them could give us information about that strange garden, lying away by itself in the heart of an almost unknown tract of country.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">At last, the day came, on which we expected the driver to come across for us. He arrived early, while we were still abed; and, the first thing we knew, he was at the opening of the tent, inquiring whether we had had good sport. We replied in the affirmative; and then, both together, almost in the same breath, we asked the question that was uppermost in our minds:--Did he know anything about an old garden, and a great pit, and a lake, situated some miles away, down the river; also, had he ever heard of a great house thereabouts?</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">No, he did not, and had not; yet, stay, he had heard a rumour, once upon a time, of a great, old house standing alone out in the wilderness; but, if he remembered rightly it was a place given over to the fairies; or, if that had not been so, he was certain that there had been something "quare" about it; and, anyway, he had heard nothing of it for a very long while--not since he was quite a gossoon. No, he could not remember anything particular about it; indeed, he did not know he remembered anything "at all, at all" until we questioned him.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"Look here," said Tonnison, finding that this was about all that he could tell us, "just take a walk round the village, while we dress, and find out something, if you can."</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">With a nondescript salute, the man departed on his errand; while we made haste to get into our clothes; after which, we began to prepare breakfast.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">We were just sitting down to it, when he returned.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"It's all in bed the lazy divvils is, sor," he said, with a repetition of the salute, and an appreciative eye to the good things spread out on our provision chest, which we utilised as a table.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"Oh, well, sit down," replied my friend, "and have something to eat with us." Which the man did without delay.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">After breakfast, Tonnison sent him off again on the same errand, while we sat and smoked. He was away some three-quarters of an hour, and, when he returned, it was evident that he had found out something. It appeared that he had got into conversation with an ancient man of the village, who, probably, knew more--though it was little enough--of the strange house, than any other person living.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">The substance of this knowledge was, that, in the "ancient man's" youth--and goodness knows how long back that was--there had stood a great house in the centre of the gardens, where now was left only that fragment of ruin. This house had been empty for a great while; years before his--the ancient man's--birth. It was a place shunned by the people of the village, as it had been shunned by their fathers before them. There were many things said about it, and all were of evil. No one ever went near it, either by day or night. In the village it was a synonym of all that is unholy and dreadful.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">And then, one day, a man, a stranger, had ridden through the village, and turned off down the river, in the direction of the House, as it was always termed by the villagers. Some hours afterwards, he had ridden back, taking the track by which he had come, towards Ardrahan. Then, for three months or so, nothing was heard. At the end of that time, he reappeared; but now, he was accompanied by an elderly woman, and a large number of donkeys, laden with various articles. They had passed through the village without stopping, and gone straight down the bank of the river, in the direction of the House.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">Since that time, no one, save the man whom they had chartered to bring over monthly supplies of necessaries from Ardrahan, had ever seen either of them: and him, none had ever induced to talk; evidently, he had been well paid for his trouble.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">The years had moved onwards, uneventfully enough, in that little hamlet; the man making his monthly journeys, regularly.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">One day, he had appeared as usual on his customary errand. He had passed through the village without exchanging more than a surly nod with the inhabitants and gone on towards the House. Usually, it was evening before he made the return journey. On this occasion, however, he had reappeared in the village, a few hours later, in an extraordinary state of excitement, and with the astounding information, that the House had disappeared bodily, and that a stupendous pit now yawned in the place where it had stood.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">This news, it appears, so excited the curiosity of the villagers, that they overcame their fears, and marched <I LANG=FR>en masse</I> to the place. There, they found everything, just as described by the carrier.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">This was all that we could learn. Of the author of the MS., who he was, and whence he came, we shall never know.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">His identity is, as he seems to have desired, buried for ever.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">That same day, we left the lonely village of Kraighten. We have never been there since.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, in my dreams, I see that enormous pit, surrounded, as it is, on all sides by wild trees and bushes. And the noise of the water rises upwards, and blends--in my sleep--with other and lower noises; while, over all, hangs the eternal shroud of spray.</font></P></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><HR><DIV CLASS="navbar" ALIGN=CENTER><font face="Times New Roman"><A HREF="chap26.html">    <IMG SRC="back.gif" ALT="< Back" BORDER=0 width="64" height="32"></A>		<A HREF="contents.html">    <IMG SRC="contents.gif" ALT="[ Contents ]" BORDER=0 width="128" height="32"></A><A HREF="grief.html">    <IMG SRC="next.gif" ALT="Next >" BORDER=0 width="64" height="32"></A> </font></DIV><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><a href="../../novels.html">Return to novels</a></b></font></p></BODY></HTML>
