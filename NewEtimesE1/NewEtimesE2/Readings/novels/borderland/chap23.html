My glance wandered round the room. For a minute, it had a strange, quivery appearance--unreal and unsubstantial. This disappeared, and I saw that nothing was altered in any way. I looked towards the end window--the blind was up.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"I rose to my feet, shakily. As I did so, a slight noise, in the direction of the door, attracted my attention. I glanced towards it. For a short instant, it appeared to me that it was being closed, gently. I stared, and saw that I must have been mistaken--it seemed closely shut.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"With a succession of efforts, I trod my way to the window, and looked out. The sun was just rising, lighting up the tangled wilderness of gardens. For, perhaps, a minute, I stood, and stared. I passed my hand, confusedly, across my forehead.</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"Presently, amid the chaos of my senses, a sudden thought came to me; I turned, quickly, and called to Pepper. There was no answer, and I stumbled across the room, in a quick access of fear. As I went, I tried to frame his name; but my lips were numb. I reached the table, and stooped down to him, with a catching at my heart. He was lying in the shadow of the table, and I had not been able to see him, distinctly, from the window. Now, as I stooped, I took my breath, shortly. There was no Pepper; instead, I was reaching towards an elongated, little heap of grey, ash-like dust. . . . . . .</font></P><P><font face="Times New Roman">"I must have remained, in that half-stooped position, for some minutes. I was dazed--stunned. Pepper had really passed into the land of shadows.</font></P></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><HR><DIV CLASS="navbar" ALIGN=CENTER><font face="Times New Roman"><A HREF="chap22.html">    <IMG SRC="back.gif" ALT="< Back" BORDER=0 width="64" height="32"></A><A HREF="contents.html">    <IMG SRC="contents.gif" ALT="[ Contents ]" BORDER=0 width="128" height="32"></A><A HREF="chap24.html">    <IMG SRC="next.gif" ALT="Next >" BORDER=0 width="64" height="32"></A> </font></DIV><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><a href="../../novels.html">Return to novels</a></b></font></p></BODY></HTML>
