      Example: &quot;The movie has already started; do you still want to go in?&quot; 
      Answer: &quot;Sure; better late than never!&quot; &quot;Better late than never&quot; means

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="en-us">When 
      you eat food, you first bite off one piece, then you chew it, and you 
      swallow it. If you bite off more than you can chew, you have taken a bite 
      so large that you are not able chew it. To &quot;bite off more than you can

      </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="en-us">
      Example: &quot;I thought I could finish this report within one month, but it

      Example: &quot;My first time skiing I decided to go down the most difficult

      than you can chew. </span> 
      </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="en-us">
      Example: &quot;I want you to think carefully about how many people and how much

      Example: &quot;I wanted to tell her what I really thought of her dress, but I 
      just bit my tongue.&quot; It is not always right to speak out and express what 
      comes to mind; at times you should bite your tongue and keep quiet. </span>

      Example: &quot;Whenever that professor says something I don't like, I have to
