      under pressure ... )</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you are under the gun 
      you are trying to achieve something under tremendous pressure. &quot;Everyone 
      at the office has been working under the gun since the new manager 
      arrived.&quot; There may be a threat you face, such as a [time] deadline or a 
      [sales] quota you need to meet. You are under the gun when you are working 
      hard to meet certain specific deadlines. &quot;We won't be able to leave until 
      eight today; we're under the gun to complete this issue.&quot; </font></blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Under The Weather ( not 
      feeling well ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To say that someone is 
      &quot;under the weather&quot; is to say that they are not feeling very well. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;What's wrong?&quot; Answer: &quot;I'm a bit 
      under the weather.&quot; They probably have a simple cold or flu which will go 
      away quickly. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
      Example: &quot;It's nothing serious; I'm just a bit under the weather.&quot; Being 
      &quot;under the weather&quot; reminds us that a quick change in the weather can 
      affect our health and the way we feel. </font></blockquote>

      available for anyone to take ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Something which is free 
      and available to anyone is &quot;up for grabs.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Does anyone want my ice cream? It's 
      up for grabs.&quot; If something is up for grabs, and you want it, you had 
      better grab it quickly before someone else does. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I have decided that I am finally 
      moving out of this city!&quot; Answer: &quot;Does that mean your apartment is up for 
      grabs?&quot; Another example: &quot;Quick- that table is up for grabs; let's get it 
      before someone else does.&quot; </font><p align="right">

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Variety Is The Spice Of 
      Life ( doing different things keeps life exciting...) </b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; Variety is the spice of 
      life&quot; expresses the general idea that it is good to try and do different 
      things. Just as a cook uses different spices to create the flavours in a 
      great meal, a person who enjoys interesting experiences will have a great 
      life. Example: &quot; We were originally planning to go to Mexico on our 
      vacation this year - like we did last year - but we decided to go to Egypt 
      in stead. Variety is the spice of life!&quot; </font><p align="right">

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We say &quot;water under the 
      bridge&quot; to refer to past experiences and conflicts which we have decided 
      to forget. This idiom compares these memories of the past to water which 
      has passing under [the] bridge. Example: &quot;Aren't you still angry about 
      what he said?&quot; Answer: &quot;No, that was a long time ago. It's all water under 
      the bridge.&quot; </font></blockquote>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Wear Your Heart On Your

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">People who &quot;wear their 
      heart on their sleeve&quot; express their emotions openly and freely; you can 
      see how they feel as easily as if they were &quot;wearing&quot; their &quot;heart&quot; on the 
      &quot;sleeve&quot; of their shirt. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;She's this kind of player who never 
      hides how she's feeling; she always wears her heart on her sleeve; you'll 
      don't even need to look at the score to know if she's winning or losing!&quot; 
      People who wear their heart on their sleeve do not hold back their 
      emotions, for good or for bad; it is always clear how they feel in each 
      moment. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
      &quot;Some people love him and some people hate him; but my brother always lets 
      you know how he feels; he wears his heart on his sleeve.&quot; </font></blockquote>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When there is no need to 
      tell someone something, you can say &quot;what they don't know won't hurt 
      them.&quot; </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
      &quot;Don't tell your father what happened; what he doesn't know won't hurt 
      him.&quot; Since he won't be hurt by not knowing, there is no need to tell him.

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When in Rome, do as the 
      Romans do&quot; says that when you are in a different place (&quot;when in Rome&quot;) it 
      is important to try new experiences and do as the people (&quot;the Romans&quot;) do 
      who are from that place. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I can't eat that; it looks 
      horrible!&quot; Answer: &quot;Give it a try! When in Rome, do as the Romans do.&quot; 
      People from different places have different ways of acting; you should not 
      go to a new place and act exactly as you would at home. &quot;When in Rome, do 
      as the Romans do&quot; says that you should try to do as people do who are from 
      the place you are visiting. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Are you sure we should eat this 
      with our hands?&quot; Answer: &quot;Why not? All of these people are eating it that 
      way. When in Rome, do as the Romans do!&quot; The city of Rome was the capitol 
      of the great Roman empire; there were many strange and interesting things 
      to do when people visited Rome. &quot;When in Rome, do as the Romans do&quot; says 
      you should not be uncomfortable when you are in a new place and see people 
      (&quot;Romans&quot;) doing new things; give it a try and do as the people do who are 
      from that place (&quot;do as the Romans do&quot;). </font><p align="justify">

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When it rains, it pours&quot; 
      describes how after there has been no rain for a long time it will 
      suddenly rain a lot all at once. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Sometimes we have no customers for 
      two or three hours then suddenly we get 20 people all at once; when it 
      rains, it pours!&quot; When there is a lot of rain all at once we say that it 
      is &quot;pouring&quot;. &quot;When it rains, it pours&quot; means that when something happens 
      after a long pause, it happens in large amounts. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;It looks like everyone in our 
      department is sick all at the same time. What are we going to do? When it

      something that will never happen ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Pigs are animals that do 
      not fly. &quot;When pigs fly&quot; is a time that will never come, because pigs will 
      never fly. Example: &quot;Do you think you will ever work at that company 
      again?&quot; Answer: &quot;When pigs fly!&quot; &quot;When pigs fly&quot; is an informal way to 
      joke that you will never do something. Example: &quot;Would you ever take her 
      on a date?&quot; Answer: &quot;Sure- when pigs fly!&quot; Pigs are heavy animals that 
      stay close to the ground; &quot;when pigs fly&quot; is a time that will never come.

      someone when you take them out to nice restaurants and treat them to 
      expensive food and drink. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;How was your business trip?&quot; 
      Answer: &quot;Great- they wined and dined us all week.&quot; You wine and dine 
      someone in order to build a strong personal relationship with them. 
      Example: &quot;That man is really is really crazy about my sister. He has been

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When we are in a defensive 
      position and have to make choices that we would not like to make, we say 
      that we have our &quot;back up against the wall&quot;. The wall represents an 
      external force that causes us to act in a way that we would not like. This 
      force may also prevent us from acting when we would like to. &quot;I'm sorry I 
      can't help you; I've got my back up against the wall.&quot; </font></blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Word Of Mouth ( 
      something you know because you heard it from other people ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Something that you know 
      because you heard it from others, not because you saw it or read about it, 
      is &quot;word of mouth&quot;. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Did you hear they finally arrested 
      him?&quot; Answer: &quot;That's not true; it's just word of mouth.&quot; Reply: &quot;No, it 
      is true; I saw it on TV!&quot; When you only hear something word of mouth you 
      cannot be absolutely certain that it is true because you don't know for 
      sure from whose mouth the word started.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Example: &quot;I heard at school that they are 
      going to hold the concert in the downtown area.&quot; Answer: &quot;That is just 
      word of mouth; there is no way to know if it is true yet.&quot; We do rely on 
      what other people tell us, so word of mouth is one of the ways that we get 
      our information. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Your Guess Is As Good

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you respond to 
      someone's question by saying &quot;your guess is an good as mine&quot; you are 
      letting them know that you can not speak with certainty about something. 
      If you were to answer their question, you would only be guessing. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Excuse me, what time does the bus 
      arrive?&quot; Answer: &quot;Your guess is as good as mine; I almost never take the 
      bus.&quot; Neither you nor they have enough information to answer with 
      certainty. Your next step, if it were important, would probably be to get 
      more information so you could speak with more clarity. </font>
