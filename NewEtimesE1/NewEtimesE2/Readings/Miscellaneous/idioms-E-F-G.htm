      possibly think to include<span lang="en-us">..</span> )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To bring a great many things 
  with you when you go someplace is to bring &quot;everything but the kitchen sink.&quot; 
  This is to say that you really brought a lot of stuff! You included almost 
  everything you could possibly carry. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Wow-your suitcase is huge! What do you 
  have in there? Everything but the kitchen sink?&quot; When we decide what to 
  include we want to bring &quot;everything&quot; useful &quot;but&quot; some things like &quot;the 
  kitchen sink&quot; are not possible to include; so we bring everything &quot;but&quot; the 
  kitchen sink. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;Whenever we go camping my wife wants to bring everything but the kitchen 
  sink!&quot; &quot;Everything but the kitchen sink&quot; means almost everything you could 
  possibly think to include. Example: &quot;My dad's new luxury car is great; it has 
  everything but the kitchen sink!&quot; </font>

      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Fair And Fair Alike ( the 
      same rules should apply evenly to all ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Fair and fair alike&quot; reminds 
  us that what is fair for one person should be fair for another; the rules of 
  fairness must apply evenly to all. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Peter is getting two candies but I am 
  only getting one!&quot; Answer: &quot;You had two candies earlier today, so now you are 
  even; fair and fair alike.&quot; Children often say fair and fair alike because 
  they are very concerned about what is and is not fair. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Michael stayed home to take care of 
  your sister last night, so tonight it is your turn. Fair and fair alike.&quot; 
  &quot;Fair and fair alike&quot; means that the same (&quot;alike&quot;) rules must be applied 
  evenly (&quot;alike&quot;) for it to be &quot;fair&quot;. </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Finding Your Feet ( 
      feeling more familiar in what you are doing ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;find your feet&quot; is to 
  become comfortable acting in a certain type of situation. Example: &quot;I've only 
  been at this job for a few months: I'm just finding my feet.&quot; You have gained 
  the needed skills and perform the job well, once you have found your feet.
  </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Don't worry 
  about it. We will help you while you are finding your feet.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Fixed In Your Ways ( 
      not wanting to change how you do things ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you have already decided 
  how you will do things, and you do not want to change, you are &quot;fixed in your 
  ways.&quot; Example: &quot;I tried many different things when I was young, but I'm older 
  now and more fixed in my ways.&quot; People usually become fixed in their ways 
  because they are comfortable and happy doing things one way, or because they 
  are just lazy and unwilling to change. Example: &quot;Sometimes it is hard to 
  accept that your parents are fixed in their ways.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Flash In The Pan ( a 
      sudden success that disappears quickly ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A &quot;flash in the pan&quot; is 
  success which begins suddenly and ends so quickly that it is like a &quot;flash&quot; of 
  fire &quot;in the&quot; frying &quot;pan&quot;. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;That was a great paper you wrote. Was 
  it just a flash in the pan? or are you going to be able to do it again and 
  again?&quot; A person who is a &quot;flash in the pan&quot; rises to success suddenly and 
  disappears just as quickly. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;What a great first year he had, but 
  after that... nothing!&quot; Answer: &quot;Just another flash in the pan.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">From Rags To Riches ( 
      from poor to wealthy ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A person who was poor and 
  becomes rich goes &quot;from rags to riches&quot;. The &quot;rags&quot; represent the poor old 
  clothing that they wore before they came into their &quot;riches&quot;. Quote from a 
  famous song: &quot;You know I'll never go from rags to riches!&quot; Example: &quot;My uncle 
  is a real rags to riches story.&quot; He was very poor but now he is rich. </font>
  </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Get Up On The Wrong 
      Side Of The Bed ( in a bad mood because you are having a bad day ... )</b></font><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When it seems like you have 
  been having a bad day all day, one might say that you &quot;got up on the wrong 
  side of the bed.&quot; </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;What's wrong with her today?&quot; Answer: &quot;It looks like she got up on 
  the wrong side of the bed.&quot; Sometimes when we get a bad start to our day, it 
  continues throughout the day and people notice; it is as if we started our day 
  (&quot;got up&quot;) in the wrong way (&quot;on the wrong side of the bed&quot;) which has 
  affected everything else that happened since. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I told you to pick up your things! And 
  don't play your music so loudly!&quot; Answer: &quot;Wow, looks like someone got up on 
  the wrong side of the bed!&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Don't start yelling at me just because 
  you got up on the wrong side of the bed.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Give Him The Slip 
      ( to escape from that person ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;give someone the slip&quot; is 
  to escape, or get away from that person. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Quick- there is a police car behind us; 
  let's give him the slip!&quot; Something &quot;slips&quot; (verb) when it gets away from 
  where it is supposed to be. A &quot;slip&quot; (noun) is an old English word for a fake 
  coin; if you bought something and paid for it with a fake coin, you gave the 
  seller &quot;the slip&quot;. To do something to get away from someone is to &quot;give him 
  the slip.&quot; </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My 
  brother will be at the movie tonight. Afterwards, let's give him the slip and 
  go to a party.&quot; The moment you got away from that person is the moment you 
  gave him the slip. </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Go For Broke ( bet 
      everything on the chance to win big ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You are &quot;broke&quot; when you have 
  no money; to &quot;go for broke&quot; is to risk losing everything for one chance to win 
  big. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Are you 
  sure you want to bet all of your money on that one horse?&quot; Answer: &quot;I'm going 
  for broke!&quot; &quot;Go for broke&quot; also means to take a risk, try your best, and give 
  all your energy to something. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Do you think that girl will dance with 
  me if I ask her to?&quot; Answer: &quot;Sure: go for broke!&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;The way to be successful is to decide 
  exactly what you want, then go for broke.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Great Minds Think 
      Alike ( people with great minds think like each other ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you and another person 
  think the same thing at the same time, you might say &quot;great minds think 
  alike.&quot; </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I was 
  just thinking to call you, then the phone rang and it was you calling me!&quot; 
  Answer: &quot;Great minds think alike!&quot; It is fun to say &quot;great minds think alike&quot; 
  because you are making a connection with the other person by saying that the 
  two of you, in thinking the same thing at the same time, both have great 
  minds. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I have 
  decided that this summer I am going to learn how to scuba dive.&quot; Answer: &quot;Me 
  too! I have already paid for the course. Great minds think alike!&quot; </font>
