      when we do things too quickly we are likely to end up with poor results 
      ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Haste makes waste&quot; says that 
  when we act too quickly (&quot;haste&quot;) we are more likely to make mistakes and end 
  up with poor results (&quot;waste&quot;). </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Most spelling mistakes are the result 
  of going too fast and not checking your work; haste makes waste.&quot; &quot;Haste makes 
  waste&quot; also says that it is better to do things carefully than to do them 
  quickly and carelessly. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I want you kids to take your time doing 
  your homework tonight; haste makes waste!&quot; The results that we end up with 
  when we do things carelessly are often useless and sometimes costly. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;You should always take your time when 
  doing your taxes and check your numbers very carefully; haste makes waste.&quot;

      know ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;have no idea&quot; is a strong 
  way of saying you &quot;do not know&quot; something. Example: &quot;What time is it?&quot; Answer: 
  &quot;I have no idea.&quot; To &quot;have no idea&quot; expresses that you don't have enough 
  information to make a definite statement about something. It can also be used 
  in a sentence to communicate that there is some piece of information which is 
  missing: &quot;I can't find my keys. I have no idea where I put them.&quot; </font>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You &quot;lose your head&quot; when you 
  get so angry (or upset) that you are not in control of what you do. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I don't know why I did that. I guess I 
  just lost my head!&quot; When you are overcome by emotions (especially anger) and 
  lose control of your actions, you &quot;lose your head.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;He lost his head, so they threw him out 
  of the game.&quot; </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Another 
  example: &quot;I'm sorry I did that- I just lost my head.&quot; A person who &quot;loses his 
  head&quot; is not in full control of what he does because he no longer thinks 
  clearly. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;Okay- I'll tell you what happened. But don't lose your head.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Head Over Heels ( 
      totally and uncontrollably in love ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When a person's body flips 
  over in such a way that the heels (of the feet) coming flying up over the 
  head, we say that they have gone &quot;head over heels&quot;. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;He was running so fast that when he 
  jumped and got hit he went head over heels.&quot; When a person falls in love, it 
  can also make a them feel dizzy (in the &quot;head&quot;) and out of control. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I've never seen him like this before!&quot; 
  Answer: &quot;Yes, he's completely head over heels about her.&quot; You fall &quot;head over 
  heels in love&quot; with someone when you think about that person all of the time 
  and feel almost dizzy when they are around. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I have been head over heels about my 
  girlfriend since the day I met her.&quot; </font>

      ( a second great thing happens in addition to the first ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When one great thing happens, 
  then another great thing happens on top of it, the second thing is the icing 
  on the cake. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;Today I was promoted to head of the department! And they decided to raise my 
  pay!&quot; Answer: &quot;Wow! Icing on the cake!&quot; We all love to eat delicious cake, and 
  sometimes the cake has an extra sweet layer of icing on the top; that is the 
  icing on the cake. Example: &quot;Your wife is beautiful to look at, and she is a 
  wonderful person!&quot; Answer: &quot;True; it's icing on the cake.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;We won the case, and they are going to 
  pay our legal expenses.&quot; Answer: &quot;That's the icing on the cake.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I've been accepted by the university, 
  and they've offered me a position on the basketball team!&quot; Answer: &quot;That's

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Idle Hands Are The 
      Devil's Tools ( when you have nothing to do you are more likely to get 
      into trouble ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Idle hands are the devil's 
  tools&quot; says that people (especially children) are more likely to get into 
  trouble when they feel bored and have nothing to do. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My mother taught me that children 
  should always be kept busy; idle hands are the devil's tools!&quot; The &quot;Devil&quot; (in 
  the Christian bible) is the bad angel who fights against God by getting people 
  to do bad things. The Devil uses whatever tools are available. &quot;Idle hands&quot; 
  are the hands of a person who is not doing anything. &quot;Idle hands are the 
  devil's tools&quot; because when you are not busy you may end up doing things which 
  you should not do. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;It makes me nervous to see those kids outside just standing around; 
  idle hands are the devils tools!&quot; Hands often represent action, but idle hands 
  are hands that are not acting; they are waiting and looking for something to 
  do. &quot;Idle hands are the devil's tools&quot; says that when people are idle they 
  will find things to do which they should not do. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I'd like you to keep the kids very busy 
  while we are gone; they get into trouble easily and idle hands are the devil's 
  tools.&quot;</font><blockquote>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">If It's Not One Thing, 
      It's Another ( too many things are going wrong, one after another )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When many different things are 
  going wrong in a short period of time people sometimes say &quot;If it's not one 
  thing, it's another!&quot; This is to say that if &quot;one thing&quot; is not causing a 
  problem, &quot;another&quot; is. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;First the car broke down, and now I can't find my keys! If it's not 
  one thing, it's another!&quot; This can also mean that you are busy with too many 
  things to do. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;I've got to wash the dishes and do the laundry, and now I hear the baby 
  crying! If it's not one thing, it's another!&quot; When it seems that no matter 
  where you look there is one more thing you need to do or you discover another 
  problem, you might say &quot;If it's not one thing, it's another!&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">In And Out ( the 
      details you know from your experience ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To know something very well is 
  to know it &quot;in and out.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I've been in this business for 30 
  years. I know it in and out.&quot; &quot;In and out&quot; is the way you know something when 
  you know it very well. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;I know this city in and out.&quot; When you add the &quot;s&quot; and say &quot;the ins 
  and outs,&quot; you are talking about the special ways that you know to do 
  something, when you know it very well. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I hope you can help me; I want to learn 
  the ins and outs.&quot; Grammar point: &quot;The ins and outs&quot; acts like a noun (&quot;teach 
  me the ins and outs&quot;); while &quot;in and out&quot; acts like an adverb (&quot;I know this in 
  and out&quot;). </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;In Over Your Head 
      ( the situation is too difficult for you ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The analogy is to an unskilled 
  swimmer who has fallen into water that is too deep. You are in over your head 
  when you face a challenge you are not able to meet. &quot;The new PR Manager felt 
  like she was in over her head during her first week at the new job.&quot; &quot;Over 
  one's head&quot; refers to the depth of the situation one is in. The situation has 
  become more serious (severe) than the person is prepared for. &quot;Go ahead and 
  lead the meeting today; I'll help you out if you get in over your head.&quot; 
  {also: &quot;in too deep&quot;} </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">In The Dark ( you did 
      not know about it ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you do not know 
  something, you are &quot;in the dark&quot;. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot; Did you understand question number 
  three?&quot; Answer: &quot;Not at all, I was totally in the dark.&quot; To be in the dark 
  about something is to not know it nor understand it. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Did you know that today was her 
  birthday?&quot; Answer: &quot;No, I was in the dark.&quot; When you are in the dark, it is as 
  if the lights were off and you could not see. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Why didn't you tell me they were having 
  a party?&quot; Answer: &quot;I was in the dark about it, just like you.&quot; </font>

      moment ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;heat of the moment&quot; 
  describes the immediacy and aliveness of being very involved in something. To 
  be &quot;in the heat of the moment&quot; is to be in the midst of some activity and 
  under the influence of that event. Example: &quot;You never really know for sure 
  what you will do in the heat of the moment.&quot; In the heat of the moment we 
  sometimes do or say things which we regret later.<span lang="en-us"> </span>
  &quot;He was so frustrated that in the heat of the moment he quit his job.&quot; 
  Sometimes people are &quot;lost&quot; in the heat of the moment, which usually means 
  that they lose some aspect of self-control. &quot;He was lost in the heat of the 
  moment and tried to punch the police officer.&quot; </font>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You are &quot;in the doghouse&quot; when 
  you have done something which has made someone angry. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;You kids will be in the doghouse with 
  your mother after that mess you made in her garden!&quot; A dog who has misbehaved 
  may be put on a leash and forced to stay in the doghouse. A person who is &quot;in 
  the doghouse&quot; [with someone] has likely done something to anger that person 
  and will have to face some kind of punishment. </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">It Takes Two To Tango ( 
      when two people have a conflict, both people are at fault ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It takes two to tango&quot; means 
  that two people in a fight are both responsible for that fight. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;He hit me first; it wasn't my fault!&quot; 
  Answer: &quot;It takes two to tango.&quot; Just like a dance between two lovers (the 
  tango); one person might start the fight, but they both keep it going; it 
  takes two [people] to [dance the] tango. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Her husband is awful; they fight all 
  the time.&quot; Answer: &quot;It takes two to tango.&quot; A conflict is not the fault of 
  just one person or the other; they are often both to blame, because it takes 
  two to tango. </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Its Anyone's Call 
      ( it is difficult to judge the outcome of a competition ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;call&quot; something here means 
  to make a decision about it. In a sport such as baseball a referee is the 
  person whose job is to &quot;make the call&quot; in any particular situation. When the 
  play is so close that we can't be sure what the correct call should be, we say 
  it is &quot;anyone's call&quot;. To say it is &quot;anyone's call&quot; is to say that no one 
  person's information is better than any other person's. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Who do you think will win this 
  election?&quot; Answer: &quot;Its anyone's call.&quot; {also: Too close to call} </font>
