      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Can't Cut The Mustard ( 
      to pass the requirements of membership ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To be able to do something at 
  a certain level is to &quot;cut the mustard&quot;. If you can't cut the mustard, you 
  aren't allowed to participate. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Did you hear that Williams got fired?&quot; 
  Answer: &quot;Yes, he couldn't cut the mustard.&quot; It is as if cutting the mustard 
  were a certain test that you had to pass in order to belong. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Bob dropped out of medical school; he 
  couldn't cut the mustard.&quot; If you don't work hard enough, or if you just 
  aren't good enough, you can't cut the mustard. </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Cold Turkey ( to quit 
      taking a drug by stopping suddenly ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To go &quot;cold turkey&quot; is to quit 
  smoking (cigarettes), drinking (alcohol), or taking some other (habit-forming) 
  drug by stopping completely, all at once. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Did it take you a long time to quit 
  smoking?&quot; Answer: &quot;No, I went cold turkey, and I never went back.&quot; People 
  often go cold turkey when they want to stop immediately the problems a drug is 
  creating, but it can be difficult to quit a drug suddenly. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My doctor gave me morphine to take 
  after surgery, but he gave me less each day so I would not need to go cold 
  turkey.&quot; Example: &quot;I want to quit drinking right now. As of this moment, I am 
  going cold turkey.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Come Hell Or High Water 
      ( no matter what else happens ... )</b></font><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Come hell or high water&quot; 
  makes clear that some future event will happen and no other event will stop it 
  from happening. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;Will you be at the family reunion next year?&quot; Answer: &quot;Yes- we'll be 
  there, come hell or high water!&quot; Even if events became totally chaotic 
  (&quot;hell&quot;) or there were natural disasters (&quot;high waters&quot;) the future event 
  would still occur.<br>
  *The word &quot;hell&quot; is informal and should not be used in polite situations.

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Cross Your Fingers ( 
      let's hope that our wish comes true ... )</b></font><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">An old superstition says that 
  if you &quot;cross your fingers&quot; (usually two fingers of the same hand) it will 
  bring good luck.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;Good luck on your test tomorrow; we are crossing our fingers for 
  you!&quot; Answer: &quot;Thanks!&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I don't know what Santa Claus will 
  bring for Christmas, but I am crossing my fingers that it will be a bicycle!&quot; 
  The meaning of &quot;cross your fingers&quot; is a bit different when we say &quot;don't&quot; 
  cross your fingers; this means we believe there is a good chance that what we 
  want to happen will not happen. We don't want our expectations to be too high 
  so we say don't cross your fingers; it means don't hope too much for what you 
  want because it probably won't happen. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;It would be great if our team won 
  today, but don't cross your fingers!&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;We hope our son will get accepted to 
  medical school and go on to become a doctor, but we are not crossing our 
  fingers.&quot; A common saying: &quot;Let's cross our fingers and hope for the best!&quot;

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Cry Over Spilt Milk ( 
      continue complaining about something that cannot be changed ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;cry over spilt milk&quot; is to 
  allow oneself to be bothered by some loss that happened in the past. The 
  analogy is to ones reaction after having spilled (spilt) milk. Once milk has 
  been spilled, it is essentially wasted. The mess can be cleaned up, but the 
  milk is lost. After cleaning up the mess, one must move on. To continue to 
  regret the experience would serve no purpose. When children complain about 
  breaking something which cannot be fixed, their parents often tell them to 
  &quot;stop crying over spilt milk!&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Cry Wolf ( to pretend 
      you need help when you really don't ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;cry wolf&quot; is to complain 
  that you are in danger when you really are not in danger. &quot;Crying wolf&quot; 
  results in other people not believing you when you really do need their help.
  </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Mom, Dad! Can 
  you please come to my room? I think there is something under the bed!&quot; Answer: 
  &quot;Son, you just go back to bed and stop crying wolf.&quot; There is a story about a 
  boy who liked to cry &quot;wolf!&quot; pretending that he was going to be eaten by a 
  wolf; when people came running to help him they found him laughing because he 
  was not really in danger. This happened a number of times and people stopped 
  believing him when he cried &quot;wolf!&quot; Finally, the boy was attacked and killed 
  by a real wolf and no one came to save him because they all thought he was 
  &quot;just crying wolf.&quot; </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;That kid on the other team just fell down; it looks like he might be 
  hurt!&quot; Answer: &quot;He's not hurt; he's just crying wolf.&quot; To &quot;cry wolf&quot; is to 
  call others for help when you do not really need help. </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Curiosity Killed 
      The Cat ( sometimes our curiosity gets us into trouble ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Curiosity killed the cat&quot; 
  recalls a story in which &quot;the cat&quot; was killed because he was too curious and 
  followed &quot;curiosity&quot; too far. &quot;Curiosity killed the cat&quot; reminds us that being 
  too curious can be dangerous. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;That reporter has been asking a lot of 
  questions and the boss doesn't like it.&quot; Answer: &quot;Somebody ought to teach him 
  that curiosity killed the cat!&quot; Cats are curious animals who like to 
  investigate things, but their curiosity sometimes takes them places where they 
  might get hurt. Children especially, like cats, are curious and like to test 
  to find out what is dangerous. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My son just stuck his finger right into 
  the electrical outlet to find out how it would feel. Thank goodness he was 
  okay!&quot; Answer: &quot;Wow, I'm glad he wasn't hurt. Curiosity killed the cat.&quot; 
  Example: &quot;Hey, I wonder what's down that street; it looks awfully dark and 
  creepy.&quot; Answer: &quot;Let's not try to find out. Curiosity killed the cat.&quot; </font>
