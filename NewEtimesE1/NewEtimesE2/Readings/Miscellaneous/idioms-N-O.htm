      And Neck ( two sides are competing evenly ... )</span></b></font><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="en-us">Neck and 
  neck refers to the state that two competitors are in when they compete evenly 
  in a race. We can imagine two people running in a race side by side barely 
  &quot;necking&quot; ahead of each other. Both of them strain to stick their heads 
  forward as the first one to cross the finish line is the winner. &quot;They're 
  coming around the final corner. They're neck and neck!&quot; </span></font>

      <p align="left"><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Never 
      Bite The Hand That Feeds You ( never hurt someone who is helping you ... )</font></span></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;bite 
  the hand that feeds you&quot; is to harm someone who has been helping you. Example: 
  &quot;He runs a good business and is polite with each of his customers; he never 
  bites the hand that feeds him.&quot; &quot;Never bite the hand that feeds you&quot; says that 
  if you feed an animal and it bites you on the hand you will probably not feed 
  it again. Example: &quot;We have been your best customers for years. How could you 
  suddenly treat us so rudely? You should never bite the hand that feeds you.&quot;
  </font></span>

      <p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Nose 
      Out Of Joint ( upset about what happened ... )</font></span></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Your &quot;nose 
  is out of joint&quot; when the look on your face and the way you act shows other 
  people that you are upset. Example: &quot;What's wrong with him?&quot; Answer: &quot;His nose 
  is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party.&quot; Although a nose 
  cannot actually be &quot;out of joint&quot;, the way a finger or an arm comes out of 
  joint, a person who is upset may have a strange look on their face until they 
  recover. Example: &quot;What happened was an accident; there is no reason for you 
  to have your nose out of joint.&quot; Another example: &quot;We were only joking; don't 
  get your nose out of joint.&quot; </font></span>

      <p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Off 
      Limits ( it is not okay to go to that place ... )</font></span></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Off 
  limits&quot; describes a place where you are not allowed to go. Example: &quot;The park 
  is off limits; I do not want you going in there.&quot; Children like to forget 
  where they're not supposed to go, so parents often remind them which places 
  are off limits. </font></span><p align="justify"><span lang="en-us">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;When you are wearing muddy shoes: the 
  house is off limits!&quot; Example: &quot;Don't let the dog go into the kitchen: It's 
  off limits to him.&quot; You can use &quot;off limits&quot; in creative ways when place 
  limits on what people can do: &quot;I don't want you dating high school boys; you 
  are too young and they are off limits.&quot; </font></span>
  <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">
      Example: &quot;Guns are off limits within New York City.&quot; </font></span></blockquote>

      <p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Off 
      On The Wrong Foot ( starting off badly ... )</font></span></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">To get off 
  to a bad start is to get &quot;off on the wrong foot.&quot; </font></span><p align="justify">
  <span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Tomorrow is our 
  first meeting with this client so let's not get off on the wrong foot.&quot; To 
  start off on a journey we must first get &quot;off on&quot; one foot and it is important 
  to get off on the &quot;right foot&quot;, not the &quot;wrong foot.&quot; </font></span><p align="justify">
  <span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Let's try to start 
  on time tomorrow and get off on the right foot.&quot; A relationship which has 
  begun badly is &quot;off on the wrong foot.&quot; Example: &quot;We didn't have a good day 
  filming today; we got off on the wrong foot.&quot; </font></span><p align="justify">
  <span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Sometimes it's hard 
  to fix things when you get off on the wrong foot.&quot; </font></span>

      <p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Off 
      The Hook ( free from a difficult situation ... )</font></span></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">To be in a 
  difficult situation is like hanging &quot;on&quot; a &quot;hook&quot;; to get free of the problem 
  you must get &quot;off the hook&quot;. Example: &quot;We've caught you again, but this time 
  you won't get off the hook so easily!&quot; You are &quot;off the hook&quot; when you are no 
  longer responsible for some problematic situation. Example: &quot;We found the guy 
  who stole the money, so we know you didn't do it; you're off the hook.&quot; When 
  you get yourself free from a difficult situation you are no longer &quot;on the 
  hook&quot;; you are &quot;off the hook.&quot; Example: &quot;You're lucky; it turns out that Dad 
  never heard you come in late last night.&quot; Answer: &quot;Great, that means I'm off 
  the hook!&quot; </font></span>

      <p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;On 
      Pins And Needles ( to be very nervous about something happening ... )</font></span></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">You are &quot;on 
  pins and needles&quot; when you are very nervous about something happening. </font>
  </span><p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;There had been a rumor that someone was going to get fired, but we 
  didn't know who it would be; so the whole office was on pins on needles all 
  day.&quot; You are &quot;on pins and needles&quot; when you feel as if you were walking with 
  pins and needles &quot;on&quot; the floor beneath your feet; if you made one wrong step 
  you might get stuck painfully by the pins and needles! </font></span><p align="justify">
  <span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Dad is doing the 
  taxes today and it has him in such a bad mood that our whole family is on pins 
  and needles.&quot; When you are &quot;on pins and needles&quot; you feel nervous or worried 
  that something bad might happen. Example: &quot;Jean was on pins and needles the 
  whole time her father was in the hospital.&quot; </font></span>

<p align="justify"><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">On The 
Fence ( you are still undecided ... )</font></span></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Times New Roman">One who 
      is facing a choice but is &quot;on the fence&quot; has not decided what choice they 
      will make. Example: &quot;Which school do you prefer?&quot; Answer: &quot;I don't know; 
      I'm on the fence.&quot; You are on the fence when you have not yet decided. 
      Example: &quot;Has he decided whether he will take the job yet?&quot; Answer: &quot;No, 
      he's still on the fence.&quot; You are on the fence until you commit yourself 
      and make a decision. </font></span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">On The Same Page ( different 
people are looking at an issue in the same way, as when reading from the same 
page ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In business meetings and 
      college classes people often make copies of a single report and hand a 
      copy to each person at the meeting. While they discuss the different 
      points in the report, each person needs to be reading from the same page 
      (&quot;on the same page&quot;). Everyone is &quot;on the same page&quot; when they are all 
      following along and understanding the basic idea that the group is 
      sharing. &quot;On the same page&quot; has a further meaning of people being in basic 
      understanding and agreement on something. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Before we make any decisions today, 
      I'd like to make sure that everyone is on the same page.&quot; People are &quot;on 
      the same page&quot; when they look at a problem or a situation in the same way 
      and agree on a course of action. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Each of us has been busy with his 
      own projects lately, so I called this meeting today to bring us all 
      together on the same page.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">On Top Of The World ( you are 
feeling great ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you are &quot;on top of 
      the world,&quot; you are feeling great. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;What a beautiful day, today. I am 
      on top of the world!&quot; Sometimes you are &quot;on top of the world&quot; because a 
      great thing happened to you; other times it is just because you are 
      feeling great. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
      Example: &quot;What a great time we had that night; we were on top of the 
      world!&quot; If you climbed the highest mountain and looked out to see a 
      beautiful view, you would feel great and be on top of the world. </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">On Your Last Leg ( the end is 
near ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To be &quot;on your last leg&quot; 
      is to be near the end; near collapse. You have scarce resources left to 
      complete something. &quot;Our old family dog is on her last leg (meaning tired, 
      near death). The &quot;leg&quot; here can be interpreted in two ways. First, 
      comparing a leg to the tired or injured legs of a person or an animal 
      after extended effort; there is not much left to stand on. A &quot;leg&quot; is also 
      a counting word for a segment of a long journey. &quot;I would be glad to sell 
      you my car, but I must tell you that it is on its last leg.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">One For The Road ( one more, 
then I am leaving ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;One for the road&quot; is when 
      you do one last thing before leaving some place. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Come on, let's play one more game 
      of pool for the road.&quot; This saying often expresses having one last drink. 
      Example: &quot;Bartender- I'll have one more whiskey for the road.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Out And About ( out and at 
different places ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You are &quot;out and about&quot; 
      when you go out of your place and you move about to different places.
      </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Is Bob 
      here today?&quot; Answer: &quot;No, he's not. He's out and about.&quot; When you say he 
      is out and about, you are not being specific about where he has gone.
      </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Did you 
      spend much time at your hotel?&quot; Answer: &quot;No we did not. Most of the time 
      we were out and about.&quot; Another example: &quot;Where have you been all day?&quot; 
      Answer: &quot;Oh, out and about.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind ( 
you don't think about it when you can no longer see it ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">There are some things 
      which we think about only as long as we can see them in front of us; when 
      we can no longer see them (out of sight) we forget about them (out of 
      mind). Example: &quot;As soon as I leave the room, he just forgets what I told 
      him to do!&quot; Answer: &quot;Out of sight, out of mind.&quot; Something which is easily 
      fo<span lang="en-us">r</span>gotten when you can no longer see it is &quot;out 
      of sight, out of mind.&quot; Example: &quot;I meant to read that book, but as soon 
      as I put it down, I forgot about it.&quot; Answer: &quot;Out of sight, out of mind.&quot; 
      Some things we need to see (sight) in order to remember (mind); they are 
      &quot;out of sight, out of mind.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Out Of The Blue ( it 
happened suddenly and unexpectedly ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Something which happens 
      suddenly and unexpectedly is &quot;out of the blue.&quot; Example: &quot;They seemed to 
      be talking calmly when out of the blue she slapped him in the face.&quot; It is 
      as if suddenly it started raining on a day when the sky was clear and 
      blue. You are su<span lang="en-us">r</span>prised and unprepared because 
      you did not see it coming when it happens &quot;out of the blue.&quot; Example: &quot;Why 
      did she do that?&quot; Answer: &quot;I have no idea. It was completely out of the 
      blue.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Out Of The Frying Pan And 
Into The Fire ( out of one difficult situation and into a more difficult one ... 
)</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To get out of one 
      difficult situation only to end up in a more difficult one is to go &quot;out 
      of the frying pan and into the fire.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Her ex-husband was terrible; but 
      the new one is even worse!&quot; Answer: &quot;Out of the frying pan and into the 
      fire!&quot; </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I 
      didn't like that job because I was working too hard. Yet in this new job I 
      work even harder!&quot; Answer: &quot;Out of the frying pan and into the fire.&quot; A 
      &quot;frying pan&quot; is a very hot place to be because it is over the fire. We 
      sometimes want so much to get out of a difficult situation that we end up 
      jumping into an even worse one. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;They always complain about how much 
      homework they have in school. Wait and see how hard they have to work 
      after they graduate!&quot; Answer: &quot;Out of the frying pan and into the fire.&quot;

<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Out Of The Woods ( recovered 
to safety after a dangerous experience ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you emerge safely 
      (out of danger) after a difficult time we say that you are &quot;out of the 
      woods.&quot; Example: Joe was sick two weeks ago and we were very worried, but 
      now it looks like he is out of the woods.&quot; The &quot;woods&quot; can be a dark and 
      dangerous place for those who cannot find their way out; we hope that they 
      will return safely &quot;out of the woods&quot;. Example: &quot;It is true that the 
      economy is getting stronger, but we are not out of the woods yet.&quot; When 
      people overcome difficult challenges and arrive safely &quot;out of&quot; danger we 
      say that they are &quot;out of the woods.&quot; Example: &quot;It is halftime and we are 
      winning this game but let's remember that we are still not out of the 
      woods!&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Out Of Your Element ( in an 
uncomfortable situation ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To be out of your element 
      is to be uncomfortable with your environment. People usually don't perform 
      well when they are out of their element. Example: &quot;I often feel out of my 
      element when traveling in a non-English speaking country.&quot; A person is 
      also out of their element when they are trying to do something that they 
      are not good at doing. Example: &quot;He is a great tennis player on the hard 
      courts, but he is out of his element on grass.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Out On The Town ( to go

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you go out partying 
      and having fun at public places like bars, restaurants, and theatres, you 
      are &quot;out on the town.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I arrive Friday evening and I'll be 
      done with all of my work.&quot; Answer: &quot;Great; we're going out on the town!&quot; 
      When you are &quot;out on the town,&quot; you are out at places where people enjoy 
      themselves and celebrate together. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Do you want to join us tonight? 
      We're going out on the town.&quot; Another example: &quot;Are you staying home 
      tonight?&quot; Answer: &quot;No way! I'm going out on the town!&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Over My Dead Body ( 
there is no way I will allow you to do that ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you absolutely will 
      not allow a person to do something you might say &quot;over my dead body.&quot; The 
      [literal] meaning is that you will stand in the way of that person and 
      only if they kill you and walk over your dead body will they be able to do 
      what they want. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
      Example: &quot;You kids are not going out in the cold without your jackets! Not 
      over my dead body!&quot; Parents say &quot;over my dead body&quot; often because they are 
      in a position of authority and they are much bigger than their children.
      </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;All of my
