      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Keep An Eye On Him ( 
      watch him carefully ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;keep an eye on&quot; someone is 
  to watch that person carefully.</font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Example: &quot;Would you keep an eye on my son 
  for me while I am gone?&quot; You take a share of responsibility for something when 
  you agree to keep an eye on it.</font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Example: &quot;I have to run to the bathroom. 
  Can you keep an eye on my suitcase while I am gone?&quot; Another example: &quot;Be 
  careful what you do today. I'll be keeping an eye on you.&quot; </font>
  </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Labor Of Love ( work 
      which you do for love ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A &quot;labor of love&quot; is something 
  that you do because of love or because you love to do it. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;They always want to pay me for the work 
  I do at the hospital, but I will never accept their money. I do it because it 
  is a labor of love.&quot; &quot;Labor&quot; is work that we do and we don't always care for 
  our work, but a labor of love is labor we do because we love dong it, or we do 
  it for someone we love. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My Dad took care of his mother for many 
  years and kept her comfortable even after she became very sick; it was a real 
  labor of love.&quot; Even the most difficult task seems easy to us when they are a 
  &quot;labor of love.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Lend Me Your Ear ( 
      please listen to me ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Lend me your ear&quot; is a polite 
  way of asking for a person's full attention to listen to what you will say.
  </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Could you 
  lend me your ear for a minute? I need to talk with you about something.&quot; &quot;Lend 
  me your ear&quot; requests a closeness between the speaker and the listener that 
  allows them to think together. Shakespeare used &quot;lend me your ear&quot; (in the 
  play titled Julius Ceasar) when Mark Antony says: &quot;Friends, Romans, 
  countrymen; lend me your ear.&quot; You say &quot;lend me your ear&quot; when you want to 
  speak directly to a person about things that are important. </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Let Bygones Be Bygones 
      ( forget about the disagreement ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A &quot;bygone&quot; is something which 
  has already happened; the time when it happened has &quot;gone by&quot;. We say &quot;let 
  bygones be bygones&quot; to people who have had a disagreement in the past when we 
  want them to move forward leaving their disagreement in the past. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;You and I have had our disagreements; 
  let's let bygones be bygones.&quot; {often used with: Forgive and forget} </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Let Sleeping Dogs 
      Lie ( don't restart this conflict ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;let sleeping dogs lie&quot; is 
  to avoid restarting old conflicts. Revisiting an old conflict is like waking a 
  sleeping dog; we are better not to do it. Example: &quot;I wanted to ask her what 
  she thought of her ex-husband, but I figured it was better to let sleeping 
  dogs lie.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Let The Cat Out 
      Of The Bag ( to share a piece of information which had been kept as a 
      secret ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A secret is like a &quot;cat&quot; which 
  has been kept in a &quot;bag&quot;; when it is &quot;let out of the bag&quot; it goes wherever it 
  wants. To &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot; is to tell something which had until 
  that time been kept as a secret. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;We were going to keep our plans to get 
  married as a family secret, but my mother let the cat out of the bag.&quot; The 
  person who told the secret is the one who &quot;let the cat out of the bag.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Bob didn't tell anyone that he was 
  sick, but his wife let the cat out of the bag.&quot; </font>
  </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Method To My Madness ( 
      what appears to by crazy action is actually done for a good reason ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Method&quot; is the careful, 
  systematic way that something intelligent is done. &quot;Madness&quot; is the strange, 
  meaningless action of a crazy person. There is &quot;method to one's madness&quot; when 
  what looks like strange and meaningless action (madness) is actually the 
  result of a carefully reasoned plan (method). </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Give me a moment to explain; there is 
  method to my madness.&quot; [This idiom comes from Hamlet by William Shakespeare, 
  Polonius speaking: &quot;Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.&quot;]
  </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;We thought he 
  was crazy to do it that way, but it turned out that there was method to his 
  madness.&quot; (Note: Americans usually say &quot;method to one's madness&quot; while British 
  say &quot;method in one's madness.&quot; Both are fine to use.) </font>
