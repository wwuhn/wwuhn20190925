<b>      A Blessing In Disguise ( a good thing that you don't recognize at first 
      ... )</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"A blessing in disguise" is a good thing that you don't recognize 
            at first as a good thing. Example: "The hotel is full tonight; we 
            will need to find a new place to stay." Answer: "Maybe it's just a 
            blessing in disguise; I've been wanting to try a new place anyway."
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Some people believe that good things are really "blessings" (gifts 
            from God), that we don't always recognize for what they are at 
            first. Example: "I lost my job and was upset at first, but I found a 
            better one and have been much happier since." Answer: "Losing your 
            job was just a blessing in disguise!" </font> <p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">It is as if the good thing (a 
            blessing) were wearing the clothes (in disguise) of some other 
            thing, so at first you do not see it as the good thing that it 
            really is. Example: "My car broke down again, but maybe it was a 
            blessing in disguise; I've been wasting too much time driving around 
            anyway." </font></blockquote>

<b>      A Chip On Your Shoulder ( angry about something that happened in the past 
      ... )</b></font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A person who is angry about something which happened in the past 
            has a chip on their shoulder. Example: "He lost his game this 
            morning and now he has a chip on his shoulder." To challenge others 
            to fight, men used to put a chip (of wood) on their shoulder and 
            offer others to knock it off. </font> </p>
<p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">A person with a chip on their shoulder 
            arrives with something already bothering them, so it is easy for 
            them to become irritated and get in a fight. Example: "Watch out for 
            that guy, he's got a chip on his shoulder." </font>  <p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">We sometimes prefer to 
            just ignore people who have a chip on their shoulder, because we 
            know that whatever is bothering them ("the chip") does not have to 
            do with us. Example: "What's bothering that guy?" Answer: "Nothing; 
            he's just got a chip on the shoulder." </font>  <p align="justify">

<font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we know why a 
            person has a chip on their shoulder; at other times, we do not. 
            Example: "He had a tough time growing up so he's got a bit of a chip 
            on his shoulder." You can use the definite article ("the") which 
            sounds more general ("a chip on the shoulder"), but more often 
            people use the personal pronoun ("his", "her", "their") to say that  
            that specific person has "a chip on his (her, their) shoulder."

<b>A Toss-Up ( the results have not been decided ... )</b></font></p>

<blockquote>

<p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">When something is a &quot;toss-up&quot;, we are not sure what the result will be. The 
analogy is to tossing a coin as a way of making a decision. When &quot;flipping&quot; (or 
&quot;tossing&quot;) a coin there is a 50 percent chance that the toss will end up one way 
and a 50 percent chance that the toss will end up another way. When something is 
very close and we can't tell if it should be one way or the other, we say that 
it is a toss-up.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing ( a dangerous person who pretends to be
      harmless ... )</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A person who appears harmless but is really dangerous 
      is &quot;a wolf in sheep's clothing.&quot; </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I want you to stay away from 
      that boy; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing!&quot; In past times wolves had a 
      reputation as wild and dangerous animals that hunted and killed sheep. A 
      &quot;wolf in sheep's clothing&quot; is a person who plans to do something bad (&quot;a 
      wolf&quot;) while pretending to be good and innocent (&quot;in sheep's clothing&quot;).
      </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Don't trust the salespeople at that store; they are all wolves 
      in sheep's clothing!&quot; Example: &quot;That young girl may look cute, but she is 
      a wolf in sheep's clothing.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>About Face ( turn around and face the opposite 
      direction ... )</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;About face&quot; is when you first face one direction, then 
      you turn completely to face the opposite direction. You do an &quot;about face&quot; 
      when you stand facing north, for example, then turn your body in one step 
      until you are facing south. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;If ever you discover that you are 
      walking down a dangerous street, it is best to do an about face and walk 
      in the other direction.&quot; The term &quot;about face!&quot; is used in the military: 
      The drill sergeant shouts &quot;about face!&quot; and all of the soldiers turn in 
      one step to face the opposite direction. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Do an about face, get 
      back in that bathroom, and brush your teeth!&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Absence Makes The Heart Grow Fonder ( you care for a 
      person even more when you spend time away from them ... )</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot; says that the 
      time you spend away from someone you love (absence) makes you love that 
      person even more (the heart grows fonder). The word &quot;absence&quot; means to be 
      away. To &quot;grow fonder&quot; is to care more. &quot;Absence makes the heart grow 
      fonder&quot; says that you care even more for a person when you spend time away 
      from them.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Does it bother you that your husband goes away on 
      such long business trips?&quot; Answer: &quot;Not at all. The time we spend apart 
      has been good for us; absence makes the heart grow fonder.&quot; When someone 
      you care for is away, you miss them and think about them; that makes you 
      want to be with them even more.</font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;It is interesting how easy it is 
      to get along with your parents when you live away from home. You miss them 
      and are so glad when you see them.&quot; Reply: &quot;It's true. Absence makes the 
      heart grow fonder!&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Actions Speak Louder Than Words (we learn more from 
      people's actions than from their words ...</b>)</font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Actions speak louder than words&quot; means that your 
      actions (what you do) communicate more clearly than your words (what you 
      say). It is as if they were louder than words. &quot;Actions speak louder than 
      words&quot; means that if you want people to believe your words, you should 
      &quot;speak&quot; with your actions. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Don't tell me how to do this; show 
      me! Actions speak louder than words.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Add Fuel To The Fire (make a bad situation worse ...)</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;add fuel to the fire&quot; is to do something that makes 
      a bad situation even worse. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;When those two are fighting, I don't 
      get involved; it only adds fuel to the fire.&quot; Adding &quot;fuel&quot; (such as wood) 
      to a burning &quot;fire&quot; makes the flames burn even higher and brighter. 
      Sometimes you get involved because you want to help, but your involvement 
      only makes the problem worse, &quot;adding fuel to the fire.&quot; </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I would 
      like to do something to help, but I don't want to add fuel to the fire.&quot;
      </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Against The Clock (working to finish by a 
      certain time ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You are working &quot;against the clock&quot; when you are trying 
      to finish your work within a set amount of time. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;We worked 
      against the clock all day to get this report done by 5PM.&quot; The passing of 
      time works against you, when you are working against the clock. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
      &quot;Today do you have time to help me with my homework?&quot; Answer: &quot;No, I 
      don't. I'm already working against the clock to finish my presentation.&quot; 
      You often compare the time on the clock against how much work you have 
      left to do, when you are working &quot;against the clock.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><b>Against The Grain (to act against what is normal and 
      accepted)</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To go &quot;against the grain&quot; is to do things in a way that 
      is different from what is normal and accepted. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Why can't you 
      just do it the way everyone else does? Why do you have to go against the 
      grain?&quot; Wood grows in a way that makes it easy to cut in one direction 
      (&quot;with the grain&quot;) but hard to cut in the other direction (&quot;against the 
      grain&quot;). To do something the hard way, by going against the wishes of 
      others, is to go against the grain. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I jog at this track everyday 
      and there is always that one guy who has to go against the grain and run 
      in the opposite direction.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>All Bark And No Bite (acting aggressive but not 
      willing to fight)</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">People are &quot;all bark and 
      no bite&quot; when they threaten to do things which they are not really willing 
      to do. They are like dogs which bark to try to make you afraid but will 
      not bite you. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;The new manager threatened to fire me but I know he 
      won't do it; he is all bark and no bite.&quot; Some people are not strong 
      enough nor brave enough to actually hurt you, but they still use words to 
      try to make you afraid; they are &quot;all bark and no bite&quot;. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
      &quot;Yesterday that guy said he wanted to fight, but today he's all quiet and 
      polite. That guy is all bark and no bite!&quot; If you threaten to do something 
      that you are not really willing to do you are &quot;all bark and no bite.&quot;
      </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>All In The Same Boat (we are all in the same 
      situation facing the same challenges ...)</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We are &quot;all in the same boat&quot; means we are like people 
      who are all in the same boat so we need to work together (cooperate) in 
      order to survive. Example: &quot;We can't fight against each other; we need to 
      work together. We're all in the same boat!&quot; People who are &quot;all in the 
      same boat&quot; face the same challenges together and must work as a team. 
      </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;These may be difficult times but we're all in the same boat; we 
      can get through it together!&quot; </font>

      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>All That Glitters Is Not Gold (it may 
not be as valuable as it seems ...)</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Something which seems valuable at first may turn out to 
      be worthless. Example: &quot;Be careful when shopping for your new car; all 
      that glitters is not gold!&quot; Just because something appears valuable does 
      not mean that it really is valuable. </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Around The Block (been to different places and done 
      different things ...)</b></font><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A person who has been &quot;around the block&quot; has 
      experience, because they have been to different places and done different 
      things. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Don't think you can fool me so easily: I have been 
      around the block.&quot; You know more, because you have seen and done more, 
      once you have been around the block.</font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;You kids are too young to 
      fall in love: Wait until you have been around the block a time or two.&quot; We 
      sometimes question the type of experience a person has had when they have 
      been around the block. Example: &quot;I would stay away
      from that man if I were you. He has been around the block.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When you have been thinking about a problem, and you 
      are not able to come up with a good answer, you are at wit's end. </font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
      &quot;Can you help me to solve this problem? I'm at wit's end.&quot; Your &quot;wit&quot; is 
      your imagination and your creativity which help you to find solutions, but 
      sometimes it seems like our wit is at an end, and will not give us the
