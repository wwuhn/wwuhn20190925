      winner cannot be determined in this particular contest ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This word &quot;heat&quot; is a counting 
  word for a single speed race, such as a swimming or a running race. A dead 
  heat refers to a race that has resulted in a tie. The &quot;heat&quot; is referred to as 
  a &quot;dead&quot; because it is not possible to declare a winner. If the rules of the 
  competition do not allow for a tie, another means must be found to settle the 
  the contest. </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Dog-Eat-Dog ( 
      people are looking out for themselves only ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Dog-eat-dog&quot; describes a 
  world where people will fight for themselves only and are willing to hurt 
  other people. &quot;It's a dog-eat-dog world&quot; suggests that you must first watch 
  out for your own interests because other people will be watching out for 
  theirs. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I 
  have been in this business for twenty years. It's dog-eat-dog; the competition 
  is always trying to steal your customers.&quot; &quot;Dog-eat-dog&quot; says that a person is 
  like a &quot;dog&quot; who will &quot;eat&quot; another &quot;dog.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Note: There is no letter &quot;s&quot; at the end of any of 
  the words in &quot;dog-eat-dog.&quot; Example: &quot;That school is dog-eat-dog; students 
  will cheat and even destroy each other's work to get better grades!&quot; Sometimes 
  people say &quot;it's a dog-eat-dog world&quot; to make an excuse when they have done 
  something that hurt another person. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I can't believe you sold him your 
  motorcycle for so much money!&quot; Answer: &quot;Hey, it's a dog-eat-dog world.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Don't Count Your 
      Chickens Until They're Hatched ( don't make plans based on uncertain 
      future events ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Chickens&quot; start out as eggs, 
  and you can count the eggs, but not all of the eggs will hatch to become 
  chickens. &quot;Don't count your chickens until they're hatched&quot; means don't make 
  plans based on something happening until that thing has already happened.</font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Tomorrow I think Bill is going to give 
  you a promotion.&quot; Answer: &quot;Well, I won't count my chickens until they are 
  hatched.&quot; We cannot know for sure what will happen in the future, so although 
  we can hope for certain things, we can't expect them and we can't make plans 
  based on them happening. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Our three biggest clients are going to 
  make huge purchases next month; let's celebrate!&quot; Answer: &quot;Let's not count our 
  chickens until they are hatched. I'll wait until next month to celebrate.&quot;
  </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Next Friday I 
  will be able to pay you back that money I owe you.&quot; Answer: &quot;I won't be 
  counting my chickens...&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Don't Put All Your Eggs 
      In One Basket ( don't risk everything all at once ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;put all your eggs in one 
  basket&quot; is to risk losing everything all at one time. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My father is a very careful investor; 
  he never puts all of his eggs in one basket.&quot; If you had a certain number of 
  &quot;eggs&quot;, it would be safest to put those eggs in different &quot;baskets&quot; and not 
  &quot;put them all in one basket&quot;. To &quot;put all your eggs in one basket&quot; would be to 
  risk losing all of your &quot;eggs&quot; in case you drop that one &quot;basket&quot;. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;The best way to gamble is to only bet 
  small amounts of money and never put all your eggs in one basket.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;We know that you want to become an 
  actor and we support you, but we still want you to graduate from college. 
  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Down To The Wire ( the 
      winner will be determined at the last instant ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;wire&quot; is an analogy for 
  the finish line. The first person to cross the finish line is the winner. When 
  a race is very close it is not clear who the winner is until they &quot;cross the 
  wire.&quot; A contest goes &quot;down to the wire&quot; when it comes right down to the 
  finish line before the winner can be determined. </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Drastic Times 
      Call For Drastic Measures ( we need to take extreme actions here ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Difficult situations require 
  us to take actions that would be considered extreme if taken in other 
  situations. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;Sales have been slow and we had to let go three of our employees; drastic 
  times call for drastic measures.&quot; Actions which are more extreme than we 
  normally take are considered &quot;drastic measures.&quot; {also: &quot;desperate times call 
  for desperate measures.&quot;} </font>
