<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Par For The Course ( normal 
and expected ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Par for the course&quot; is 
      what is normal and acceptable for a particular situation. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I get sick every time I travel.&quot; 
      Answer: &quot;That's just par for the course.&quot; &quot;Par&quot; on a golf &quot;course&quot; is the 
      average number of strokes a golfer needs to get the ball in all the holes; 
      &quot;par for the course&quot; is what is usual and expected. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Things don't always work out as we 
      want in life, and that's just par for the course; we do our best and go 
      on.&quot; We should not get too bothered when things happen that are par for 
      the course, because they are regular parts of life. </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Penny-Wise, Pound-Foolish ( 
cautious with small amounts of money, but careless with larger amounts ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A penny is a small amount 
      of money and a pound is a larger amount. &quot;Penny-wise, pound-foolish&quot; is to 
      be cautious (wise) with small amounts of money but wasteful (foolish) with 
      larger amounts. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
      Example: &quot;We've worked so hard to save money that if we took a vacation 
      now it would be penny-wise, pound-foolish.&quot; People sometimes worry about 
      spending small amounts of money; then they carelessly spend much larger 
      amounts. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
      &quot;He spends very little on food during the week, then blows all his money 
      drinking on the weekends. He really is penny-wise, pound-foolish.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">People Who Live In Glass 
Houses Should Not Throw Stones ( don't criticize other people when you yourself 
have faults and weaknesses ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;People who live in glass 
      houses should not throw stones&quot; reminds us that we should be careful how 
      we treat other people (with our words and actions) because we can all be 
      easily hurt. People &quot;throw stones&quot; at other people to try to hurt them, 
      and one way that people try to hurt other people is by saying bad things 
      about them. If you lived in a &quot;glass house&quot; it would be very easy for 
      other people to hurt you by throwing stones at you. &quot;People who live in 
      glass houses should not throw stones&quot; means that we should not say 
      insulting things to other people because they could easily do the same 
      thing to us. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
      Example: &quot;Look at that shirt you are wearing! Did you buy that back in the 
      '80s?!&quot; Answer: &quot;Hey, you're not so young yourself; people who live in 
      glass houses should not throw stones!&quot; Something made of glass can easily 
      break; it is vulnerable; and we are all vulnerable in different ways. 
      Sometimes we forget our own vulnerability and &quot;throw stones&quot; at other 
      people in the form of criticism. A person might remind us that we too have 
      our own faults and weaknesses by saying &quot;people who live in glass houses 
      should not throw stones&quot;. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Look at what time it is... you are 
      late again!&quot; Answer: &quot;Hey, how often are you not on time? People who live 
      in glass houses should not throw stones.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Practice Makes Perfect ( the 
way to become great is to practice ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Practice makes perfect&quot; 
      means the more you practice at something the better you will become; if 
      you want to make yourself perfect you must practice and keep practicing. 
      Example: &quot;You see how quickly you are getting better at the piano! 
      Practice makes perfect!&quot; The only way to make yourself perfect at 
      something is to practice it everyday. Example: &quot;How does a great player 
      like Larry Bird get to be so good?&quot; Answer: &quot;By taking thousands of jump 
      shots every day. Practice; practice; practice! Practice makes perfect.&quot; To 
      practice is to do and the way to become great at something is to practice 
      it over and over. </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Practice What You Preach ( do 
things the way you tell others to do them ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;preach&quot; is to tell 
      others the right way to do something; to &quot;practice&quot; is to do the thing 
      yourself. You &quot;practice what you preach&quot; when you yourself do something 
      the same way you tell others to do it. Example: &quot;You keep telling me how 
      to hit the ball. Why don't you practice what you preach?&quot; Our actions 
      (what we do) should always be consistent with our words (what we say). 
      Example: &quot;Good managers always lead by example and practice what they 
      preach.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Preaching To The Choir ( 
trying to make believers out of people who already believe ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Preaching to the choir&quot;, 
      &quot;preaching to the chorus&quot;, and &quot;preaching to the converted&quot; all mean the 
      same thing, that the people you are trying to convince already believe in 
      what you are saying. Example: &quot;I agree with you entirely; you are 
      preaching to the choir.&quot; You are &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; when you talk 
      (preach) to people to convince them of something they already believe. 
      Example: &quot;Don't just stand there preaching to the choir; get out and find 
      new members!&quot; The members of the &quot;choir&quot; play the music, while those in 
      the &quot;chorus&quot; sing along, as the preacher preaches to change (convert) the 
      non-believers into believers (&quot;the converted&quot;). People tell you that you 
      are &quot;preaching to the converted&quot; to let you know they support your idea; 
      they also might be saying you don't need so spend so much energy to make 
      them believe what they already believe. Example: &quot;You don't need to tell 
      me this project is important; you're preaching to the converted.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Protest Too Much ( you tend 
not to believe a person because they insist too strongly that something is not 
true ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;protest too much&quot; is 
      to insist so strongly about something not being true that people begin to 
      suspect maybe it is true. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;You do like that girl, don't you?&quot; 
      Answer: &quot;No! I don't! Not at all! Why do you think so?&quot; Reply: &quot;You 
      protest too much.&quot; &quot;Protest too much&quot; comes from Hamlet by William 
      Shakespeare; the Queen speaking: &quot;The lady doth protest too much, 
      methinks.&quot; (Note: people do not usually use the word &quot;methinks&quot; when they 
      are speaking English today.) To &quot;protest too much&quot; is to insist so 
      passionately about something not being true that people suspect the 
      opposite of what you are saying. </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Do you think he is telling the 
      truth?&quot; Answer: &quot;I think he protests too much.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Pulling Your Leg ( making a 
joke by tricking another person ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When someone makes a joke 
      by lying to you and pretending that the lie is true, they are &quot;pulling 
      your leg&quot;. Example: &quot;Look; your shoes are untied... Ha! Just pulling your 
      leg.&quot; When you trick a person into believing a lie as a way of making a 
      joke, you are pulling their leg. Example: &quot;Really? That store is closed on 
      Sunday? Are you sure?&quot; Answer: &quot;Don't listen to him; he is just pulling 
      your leg.&quot; When you are the person who is being tricked, your leg is being 
      pulled. Example: &quot;I want to ask you a question and I would like an honest 
      answer; no pulling my leg.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Put Your Foot In Your Mouth ( 
to say something stupid and embarrass yourself ... )</font></b><blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;put your foot in your 
      mouth&quot; is to say the wrong thing in a certain situation and become very 
      embarrassed. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
      Example: &quot;Last night I was telling a joke and I really put my foot in my 
      mouth! I had no idea I was talking about her hometown!&quot; You can imagine 
      how embarrassed you would feel and how funny you would look if you 
      actually &quot;put your foot in your mouth.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I am so embarrassed; I had no idea 
      he could hear me in the next room when I was talking about his wife!&quot; 
      Answer: &quot;Ouch! Sounds like you really put your foot in your mouth!&quot; Note: 
      The word &quot;foot&quot; is always singular when you say &quot;foot in your mouth&quot;. When 
      you say something which makes someone feel embarrassed or causes an 
      embarrassing situation, you have &quot;put your foot in your mouth.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Let's all be very careful what we 
      say at the meeting tomorrow. I don't want anyone putting their foot in 
      their mouth.&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Raise Cain ( to disturb 
others and cause trouble ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Adam is the first man in the 
  old Judeo-Christian bible and he raised a son named Cain. Adam and Cain fought 
  often and their relationship was filled with trouble. To &quot;raise
  <span lang="en-us">C</span>ain&quot; is to cause trouble and disturb others. 
  Example: &quot;Have you two boys been out raising <span lang="en-us">C</span>ain 
  again?&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Rock The Boat ( to risk 
      upsetting the situation ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;rock the boat&quot; is to do 
  something to risk upsetting a social situation. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;We will all have to work together: I 
  don't want anyone rocking the boat!&quot; A group of people on a small boat needs 
  to work together; if one person changes position or moves suddenly, the whole 
  boat may rock dangerously - tipping from side to side. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Everybody wants to go except for you. 
  Why do you have to rock the boat?&quot; We cause trouble for other people when we 
  rock the boat, because other people need to find new positions to make the 
  boat steady again. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;I hate to rock the boat, but I think we need to rethink our 
  position.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Roll Out The Red 
      Carpet ( to give a grand welcome to an important guest ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To give a guest a very warm, 
  special welcome is to &quot;roll out the red carpet&quot;. It was a custom in past times 
  to roll out a long red carpet for an important guest who was arriving. They 
  could walk from their car to the building in style, without getting their feet 
  dirty. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Our 
  most important client will be in town tomorrow, so let's all roll out the red 
  carpet and take him out to dinner.&quot; To roll out the red carpet is to make a 
  special event about someone's arrival, and to treat him or her grandly as if 
  they were a king or a queen. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My parents are wonderful hosts; 
  whenever we are in town they always roll out the red carpet.&quot; Example: &quot;We are 
  all so excited about your coming home that we're going to roll out the red 
  carpet.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Round About ( a way 
      that is not the most direct ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You go somewhere in a &quot;round 
  about&quot; way when you follow a path that is not the most direct. Example: &quot;That 
  taxi ride was a bit round about, don't you think?&quot; You do something in a round 
  about way when your methods are not the most exact. Example: &quot;Well, I am not 
  an expert, but I can do it in a round about way.&quot; &quot;Round about&quot; describes 
  something done in a way that is not the most direct. Example: &quot;Well, I know 
  how to get there in a round about way, but maybe we should check the map.&quot;

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Rub Salt In An Old 
      Wound ( to intentionally bring back the pain of an past experience ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To &quot;rub salt in an old wound&quot; 
  is to intentionally cause someone to feel pain by revisiting a painful 
  experience. Someone may be talking about something which caused us 
  embarrassment in the past, and remembering it through discussion causes us to 
  be embarrassed or feel the pain again. Example: &quot;Hey- do you remember that 
  time you were giving a speech and you dropped your laptop computer?&quot; Answer: 
  &quot;Oh please, let's not rub salt in old wounds!&quot; </font>
