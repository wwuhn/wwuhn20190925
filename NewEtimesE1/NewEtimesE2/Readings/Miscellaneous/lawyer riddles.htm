the second part, also known as &quot;Light Bulb&quot;, do hereby and forthwith agree to a 
transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed 
from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed 
upon duties, i. e., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise illumination of the 
area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating at 
an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the 
carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the 
second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement 
between the parties. <br>
The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the 
following steps: <br>
1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at his 
option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of elevation, 
grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the 
second part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction, this point being 
non-negotiable. <br>
2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) 
becomes separated from the party of the third part (&quot;Receptacle&quot;), the party of 
the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the 
second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local 
and federal statutes. <br>
3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part

clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable. <br>
Note: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of 
the first part (Lawyer), by any or all persons authorized by him, the objective 
being to produce the most possible revenue for the party of the fifth part, also 
known as &quot;Partnership.&quot; </font></p>
