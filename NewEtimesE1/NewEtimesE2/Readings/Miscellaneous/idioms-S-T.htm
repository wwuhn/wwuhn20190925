      something which is very natural for you to do ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Something you once learned to 
  do which is now easy and comfortable to you is second nature. Example: &quot;She 
  started playing the piano when she was very young; now it is like second 
  nature to her.&quot; Example: &quot;Wow- you paint so easily!&quot; Answer: &quot;Oh, it's second 
  nature to me. I've been painting since I was a little girl.&quot; Some things 
  become second nature because you practice them over and over, others just 
  because you learn them very easily. Example: &quot;It has always been second nature 
  for me to draw with both hands.&quot; Example: &quot;Be careful about smoking; if you 
  smoke too much it becomes like second nature and you can't stop.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Shake A Leg ( move 
      faster; get going ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We say &quot;shake a leg&quot; when we 
  are waiting for someone and we want them to go faster. Example: &quot;The party is 
  starting in ten minutes. Shake a leg!&quot; To get up and go somewhere you need to 
  first move (&quot;shake&quot;) one (&quot;a&quot;) leg, then the other leg, then get going. To 
  &quot;shake a leg&quot; is to get up and get going. Example: &quot;They are waiting outside 
  in the car; let's shake a leg!&quot; Example: &quot;Come on you guys... shake a leg!&quot;

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Sink Or Swim ( you will 
      either fail or you will find a way to succeed ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Sink or swim&quot; means that you 
  will either succeed or you will fail completely. Example: &quot;Sales is a tough 
  job. We give you two weeks training and then it's sink or swim.&quot; When you are 
  thrown into water, you will either sink to the bottom or swim to safety. You 
  will either fail, or you will find a way to succeed, in a situation that is 
  sink or swim. Example: &quot;When we interview new teachers, we just put them in 
  with the students and see how they do. It's sink or swim.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Skeletons In The 
      Closet ( secrets from your past which you try not to show to other people 
      ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Skeletons in the closet&quot; are 
  things about your past which you would prefer not to tell to other people. 
  Example: &quot;He's a very popular senator but he will never be elected president; 
  he has too many skeletons in the closet.&quot; Years after a person has died, only 
  the skeleton remains, and a skeleton of bones can be a frightening thing to 
  look at. &quot;Skeletons in the closet&quot; are embarrassing things which we would like 
  to put away so other people cannot see them. Example: &quot;I don't want anything 
  to do with that guy; he has too many skeletons in the closet.&quot; Example: &quot;I had 
  only known her for one week. How could I know what skeletons she had in her 
  closet?&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="en-us">S</span>plit 
      Down The Middle ( the results are exactly the same on both sides ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Something is split down the 
  middle when it has been divided and the two sides are of the same amount. The 
  &quot;split&quot; emphasizes the act of dividing, while &quot;down the middle&quot; emphasizes 
  that the two amounts have been divided evenly. In the case of counting votes 
  to determine the winner in an election, it might not be possible to declare a 
  single winner immediately if both sides have scored the same number of votes. 
  &quot;The election is split down the middle with no clear winner at the moment.&quot;

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Start From Scratch ( 
      to begin with the very smallest parts ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Start from scratch&quot; is 
  originally a cooking term: it is when you cook a meal starting with only the 
  smallest food ingredients, which we call &quot;scratch.&quot; Example: &quot;This cake is 
  excellent. Where did you buy it?&quot; Answer: &quot;Actually, my mother made it from 
  scratch.&quot; When you build something using the smallest possible parts, you 
  &quot;start from scratch.&quot; Example: &quot;My father is excellent with cars; he started 
  with only spare parts and build this engine from scratch.&quot; When you are 
  beginning a project from the very beginning, you are &quot;starting from scratch.&quot; 
  Example: &quot;How are you going to build your business?&quot; Answer: &quot;Just like 
  everyone else does: starting from scratch.&quot;</font></blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Apple Of Your Eye ( 
      the one you love the most ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When choosing an apple, we 
  first see (eye) it and decide that it is our favorite; then we reach for it. 
  The &quot;apple of your eye&quot; is the person you have a very special feeling for. For 
  example: &quot;Even when they were young, she was always the apple of his eye.&quot; It 
  makes you feel good when you look at the person who is the &quot;apple of your 
  eye&quot;. From a famous love song: &quot;You are the apple of my eye; that's why I'll 
  always be with you.&quot; </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Ball Is In Your 
      Court ( it is your turn to do something ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When &quot;the ball is in your 
  court&quot;, it is your turn to act and you must do something. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;The seller has offered us the house for 
  $250,000; the ball is in our court. What should we do?&quot; A tennis ball goes 
  back and forth between two players; you must hit the ball when it is in your 
  court. Communication and action can be the same way; one party acts, or 
  speaks, then the other party is expected to respond. When it is your turn to 
  act, &quot;the ball is in your court&quot;. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;My uncle helped me to get an interview 
  at his company, now the ball is in my court.&quot; The responsibility for action is 
  now yours when the ball is in your court. </font>

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Best Of Both Worlds 
      ( to get the best of both choices ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The best of both worlds&quot; is 
  to have the best aspects of one choice and the best aspects of another choice 
  when you have been asked to select between two choices. Example: &quot;You can 
  either get up early tomorrow and get a lot of work done, or you can stay out 
  late tonight and have fun with your friends, but you can't have the best of 
  both worlds.&quot; Often we cannot, but sometimes we find a way to have &quot;the best 
  of both worlds,&quot;. Example: &quot;My wife and I bought one house in Paris and one in 
  New York; it gives us the best of both worlds.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Bigger They Are The 
      Harder They Fall ( we can beat this larger opponent ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It may seem more difficult to 
  beat a larger opponent, but when we beat them they suffer a greater loss than 
  smaller opponents. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
  Example: &quot;Are you worried that he might be too strong?&quot; Answer: &quot;No I'm not. 
  He is big, but the bigger they are, the harder they fall.&quot; A bigger person may 
  be harder to knock down, but when they go down they hit the ground harder.

      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Devil Is In The 
      Details ( the difficult part is in the many small details ... )</font></b><p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">When the hard part of what you are trying to do is 
in the many small details, you can say &quot;the devil is in the details.&quot; </font><p align="justify">
<font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I thought I would be able to write that 
article in two hours, but it ended up taking me five. The devil was in the 
details.&quot; The devil is known for always make life difficult for man in many 
small ways. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I 
      can sketch a basic outline of the plan for you and it may look very 
      simple, but the devil is in the details.&quot; </font><p align="justify"><b>
<font face="Times New Roman">The Early Bird Catches The Worm ( the person who is 
      early gets what they want ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The early bird catches the 
  worm&quot; means that the person who wakes up early or arrives early will be 
  successful. It is like when birds are competing for one worm; the bird that 
  arrives early will catch the worm. Example: &quot;I always arrive at work 30 
  minutes early; the early bird catches the worm!&quot; Also: &quot;From now on I'm waking 
  up at 6am; the early bird catches the worm.&quot; At times there is only one &quot;worm&quot; 
  and only one &quot;bird&quot; can catch it, so the bird to arrive early catches the 
  worm. Example: &quot;My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old; 
  the early bird catches the worm!&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Ends Justify The Means ( 
our actions are called for by this situation ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;ends&quot; are our end goals 
  and the &quot;means&quot; are the specific actions we take to achieve those goals. &quot;The 
  ends justify the means&quot; when the actions we take are considered acceptable 
  because of the specific end results we want to achieve. Example: &quot;I would 
  prefer to do things differently, but in this situation, the ends justify the 
  means.&quot; This saying is often used in the negative: &quot;I agree with your goal, 
  but the ends do not justify the means.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Jury Is Out ( it is still 
being decided ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To say &quot;the jury is [still] 
  out&quot; on something means that the final judgment has not yet been made. The 
  information has been heard, something is under consideration, and we are 
  waiting for a decision to be made. The analogy is to a court case after the 
  two sides have made their arguments but before the jury has returned a verdict 
  (final decision). It may also express that we are waiting to see what the 
  results of something will be. Example: &quot;Its hard to say if what we did was the 
  right thing. The jury is still out on it.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Pot Calling The Kettle 
Black ( to say something about someone else which is actually true of you 
yourself ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The pot&quot; (for cooking) and 
  &quot;the kettle&quot; (for boiling water) sit on the stove over the fire and become 
  black from the flames. You are &quot;the pot calling the kettle black&quot; when you 
  point to another person and accuse them of doing something which you yourself 
  are guilty of doing. Example: &quot;You are accusing me of being lazy? Ha! That's 
  the pot calling the kettle black!&quot; Example: &quot;I'm tired of you always wearing 
  my clothing!&quot; Answer: &quot;Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black! You're 
  wearing my pants right now!&quot; The pot and the kettle are like old friends who 
  have turned black with time; the pot only sees the blackness which is on the 
  kettle; he doesn't see the black on himself. Example: &quot;Here comes the guy who 
  is always late for work.&quot; Answer: &quot;Aren't you the pot calling the kettle 
  black? You are usually the last person to show up!&quot; </font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Pros And Cons ( the 
reasons for and against it; the good and bad aspects ... )</b></font><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Pro&quot; means for, and &quot;con&quot; 
  means against; &quot;the pros and cons&quot; are the reasons for and against doing 
  something. Example: &quot;Should we do it or not?&quot; Answer: &quot;First let's look at the 
  pros and cons.&quot; Before you decide to do it or not, you should try to 
  understand the reasons for doing it (the pros) and the reasons against doing 
  it (the cons). </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;Before we decide, let's be sure we understand the pros and cons.&quot; A &quot;pro&quot; is 
  a reason to do something; a &quot;con&quot; is a reason to not do it. Example: &quot;I've 
  considered the pros and cons and I've decided: it is going to be expensive, 
  but I still want to go to college.&quot; The pros and cons are the good and bad 
  aspects of some thing. </font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Sky Is The Limit ( the 
possibilities are endless ... )</b></font><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The sky is the limit&quot; when 
  there is almost no limit to how far you can go in what you are doing. Example: 
  &quot;For people who work hard at this company, the sky's the limit.&quot; You feel very 
  optimistic (positive, hopeful) about your future because there are so many 
  possibilities when &quot;the sky's the limit.&quot; Example: &quot;After I graduate from 
  business school, the sky's the limit!&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<b>The Straw That Broke The 
Camel's Back ( the very last thing which happened to finally make you upset ... 
)</b></font><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The straw that broke the 
  camel's back&quot; is the last thing that you are willing to accept after which you 
  will not put up with any more. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;He came to work late every day this 
  week and then, on Friday, he didn't show up at all. That was the straw that 
  broke the camel's back and we fired him.&quot; There is a limit as to how much 
  straw (long yellow grass) a camel can carry on its back; when you keep putting 
  on more straw it will finally break the camel's back. &quot;The straw that broke 
  the camel's back&quot; says that one has been tolerant and patient for a long time, 
  but will no longer endure even one more &quot;straw.&quot; Example: &quot;You've been rude to 
  me all day, and I've had it. That's the last straw!&quot; When you are at the &quot;last 
  straw&quot;, which is the &quot;straw that broke the camel's back,&quot; you can no longer 
  support even one more &quot;straw.&quot; </font>

<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">The Writing On The Wall ( the 
signs of a coming change ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The writing is on the wall&quot; 
  when you can see signs that there is going to be a change. Example: &quot;At that 
  point, the writing was on the wall; we all knew the company was going out of 
  business.&quot; The signs pointing to the coming change are &quot;the writing on the 
  wall&quot;; they are clear and visible to you if you look for them. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;Some people chose not to see it, but 
  the writing was on the wall; the government had to change.&quot; Another example: 
  &quot;Can't you see the writing on the wall?&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Third Wheel ( the extra 
person ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;third wheel&quot; refers to 
  the person who is the outsider when there is a group of three. Example: &quot;You 
  two go on ahead without me. I don't want to be the third wheel.&quot; An analogy 
  can be made to a two-wheeled bicycle or cart; adding a third wheel would not 
  be helpful and would limit mobility. To be the &quot;third wheel&quot; is to be the 
  extra, unnecessary person in a group of three people. Example: &quot;Missy and I 
  were going to go to the dance with another couple, but when I got sick she 
  decided to stay home also. She didn't want to be the third wheel.&quot; </font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Tie The Knot ( to get married 
... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When two people get married we 
  say that they have &quot;tied the knot.&quot; Example: &quot;After dating for five years they 
  decided to tie the knot.&quot; When you tie &quot;a&quot; knot you wrap two pieces of rope 
  around each other in a certain way so that they will not come apart. When you 
  tie &quot;the&quot; knot you make a promise that you will stay together with one person 
  whom you love. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;Did you hear about Dan and Jenny? They finally decided to tie the knot!&quot; Two 
  people are like two ropes and they get married to tie &quot;the knot&quot; which keeps 
  them together. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: 
  &quot;So when are you two going to tie the knot?&quot; </font>

<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">To Err Is Human, To Forgive 
Divine ( when people do things wrong we should try hard to forgive them because 
all people make mistakes ... )</font></b><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The verb &quot;err&quot; means to do 
  something wrong; to make a mistake is &quot;to err&quot;. &quot;To err is human&quot; because all 
  people (&quot;humans&quot;) make mistakes. &quot;To err is human, to forgive divine&quot; says we 
  should try hard to forgive others because all people are human and make 
  mistakes. </font><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I 
  am still angry about what my manager did yesterday!&quot; Answer: &quot;It is best to 
  just let it go; to err is human, to forgive divine.&quot; The world of people is 
  &quot;human&quot; and the world of God is &quot;divine&quot;. God's special power to forgive 
  people for their mistakes is called &quot;divine&quot; mercy. When we forgive other 
  people we are acting &quot;divine&quot;. &quot;To err is human, to forgive divine&quot; says that 
  we are all human and we all make mistakes so we should all try hard to forgive 
  other people when they make mistakes. </font><p align="justify">
  <font face="Times New Roman">Example: &quot;I will never forgive my mother for what 
  she has done!&quot; Answer: &quot;Don't be angry at her. To err is human, to forgive 
  divine.&quot; (Because we use the word &quot;is&quot; in the first phrase &quot;to err is human&quot; 
  we do not use &quot;is&quot; again in the second phrase: &quot;to forgive divine&quot;.) We are 
  all people who make mistakes so to forgive others when they make mistakes is 
  the right thing to do; &quot;to err is human, to forgive divine.&quot; </font>

<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Tooth And Nail ( to fight

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To fight violently is to 
      fight &quot;tooth and nail,&quot; with every &quot;tooth&quot; and every &quot;nail.&quot; Example: 
      &quot;That woman fought tooth and nail during the war to protect her children.&quot; 
      Animals sometimes fight violently with every tooth (in their mouth) and 
      every nail (on their claws). Example: &quot;That cat is terrified (very afraid) 
      of cars; try to get him in a car and he'll fight you tooth and nail.&quot; To 
      fight &quot;tooth and nail&quot; is to fight completely and with everything you 
      have. Note: &quot;Tooth&quot; and &quot;nail&quot; are both singular in &quot;tooth and nail.&quot; 
      Example: &quot;That was a tough match; they fought us tooth and nail!&quot; </font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Truer Words Were Never Spoken

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">When someone says 
      something which you find to be &quot;very&quot; true and which applies in many 
      different situations, you can say &quot;truer words were never spoken&quot;. When 
      you say this you are agreeing in a conversational way with what someone 
      has said. It is often used as a single sentence response. Example: &quot;I find 
      that the earlier I get up, the better the day I am going to have. As long 
      as I've had a good sleep.&quot; Answer:&quot; Truer words were never spoken! The
