<P class=left><font color="#000080" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intro/Chorus: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child is born with no state of mind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the ways of mankind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is smiling on you and He's frowning too 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only God knows what you'll go through, uhh 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child is born with no state of mind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the ways of mankind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is smiling but He's frowning too 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verse 1: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grew up in 
an instant, the fourth of seven children <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest 
male on the block was half and half <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brown, stones to 
neck bones, crack joints to tones <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where young girls 
spread out and drop seeds like they're farmers 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're old as their momma's, the same age as their 
aunt <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the neighborhood drunk men and that lady 
with the dreaded disease <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like hard to please 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the house of ill fate with the metal gate 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kept the thin people cracked out like 'puncheon' 
monks <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ole man with the fruit stand is on his man 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand, his ole heart just can't stand 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the CPR as they load him in the back of a car 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm on a world tour to help free the poor 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the local drug cats to kids in front of the 
store <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number runners, gang bangers and the big money 
spenders <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality check rings as we descend from the 
king <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a child 
is born with no state of mind <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the ways of 
mankind <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is smiling on you and He's frowning too 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only God knows what you'll go through 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child is born with no state of mind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the ways of mankind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is smiling but He's frowning too 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only God knows.... 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verse 2: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home's 
filled with horror in my horoscope <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow I could 
be broke, this ain't a joke <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm twenty dollars from 
bein dead ass <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm bout to spend half on a bag to get 
my head blast <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I lost to justice cycle, 
born <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spawned a riff with my wiz 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now she dead with my kids 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live by the subway, niggas push drugs in my 
hallway <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day everyday tryin to get the pay 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I be tryin ta find a better way 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, when you're poor then you're forced to 
adore to raw play <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survival be a forte, lookin 
forward to robble up your food stamps <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects' like 
boot camps <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wit generals cookin chemical warfare 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ki's to a mayor, I ain't seen ya ass in four years 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law bears down on anybody that's brown 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My complexion puts me in the direction of the section <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejection seems to be my fate 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a kid, don't wanna ship my momma, always said I 
had to wait <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's been drama up to date 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough to traumatize people's lives and the eyes 
they try to fixate <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child is born with no state of mind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the ways of mankind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is smiling on you but He's frowning too 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only God knows what you'll go through 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child is born with no state of mind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the ways of mankind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is smiling but He's frowning too 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because... <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verse 3: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born into existence with some resistance 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A struggle comin out my ol' earth's womb 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was little past noon, three months before June 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a feelin I was headed toward the land of doom 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came out and the doctor got ready to smack 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grabbed the 'bilical cord and tried to pull myself 
back <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it was too late for that cos in fact 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll slit the sack so I gotta maintain where I'm at 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I'm here breathin this diff'rent kind of air 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty bound, headed for the welfare 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug-infested, rat-infested, people drownin in 
sorrow at neighbourhood bars <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roaches bigger than my 
hot wheel cars <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dope fiends with swollen arms lookin 
like rotten wood <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn to crack monsters up and down 
the neighbourhood <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit the store, business soar as 
the crowd pour <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all thru the corridors, echo-in off 
the project walls <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why the God say 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child is born 
with no state of mind <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to the ways of mankind 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is smiling on you but He's frowning too 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because only God knows what you'll go through
