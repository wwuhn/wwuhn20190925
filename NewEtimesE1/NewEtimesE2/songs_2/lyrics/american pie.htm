<P class=left><font color="#000080" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long long time 
ago<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still remember how that 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music used to make me 
smile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I knew if I had my 
chance<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I could make those people 
dance<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And maybe they'd be happy for a 
while<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But February made me 
shiver<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every paper I'd 
deliver<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad news on the 
doorstep<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't take one more 
step<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't remember if I 
cried<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read about his widowed 
bride<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something touched me deep 
inside<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the music 
died<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So bye-bye, Miss American 
Pie<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove my Chevy to the 
levee<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the levee was 
dry<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and 
rye<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin' this'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you write the Book of 
Love<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you have faith in God 
above<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bible tells you 
so<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you believe in rock 'n 
roll<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can music save your mortal 
soul<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can you teach me how to dance real 
slow<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I know that you're in love with 
him<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cause I saw you dancin' in the 
gym<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You both kicked off your 
shoes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, I dig those rhythm and 
blues<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a lonely teenage broncin' 
buck<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a pink carnation and a pickup 
truck<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew I was out of 
luck<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the music 
died<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started singin'<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So 
bye-bye, Miss American Pie<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove my Chevy to the 
levee<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the levee was 
dry<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and 
rye<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin' this'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for ten years we've been on our 
own<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And moss grows fat on a rollin' 
stone<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that's not how it used to 
be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jester sang for the King and 
Queen<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a coat he borrowed from James 
Dean<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a voice that came from you and 
me<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and while the King was looking 
down<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jester stole his thorny 
crown<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtroom was 
adjourned<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No verdict was 
returned<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while Lennon read a book of 
Marx<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quartet practiced in the 
park<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we sang dirges in the 
dark<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the music 
died<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were singing bye-bye, Miss American 
Pie<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove my Chevy to the 
levee<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the levee was 
dry<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and 
rye<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin' this'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helter skelter in a summer 
swelter<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Birds flew off with a fallout 
shelter<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight miles high and falling 
fast<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It landed foul out on the 
grass<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players tried for a forward 
pass<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the jester on the sidelines in a 
cast<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the half-time air was sweet 
perfume<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Sergeants played a marching 
tune<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all got up to 
dance<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but we never got the 
chance<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cause the players tried to take the 
field<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marching band refused to 
yield<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you recall what was 
revealed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the music 
died<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started singing bye-bye, Miss American 
Pie<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove my Chevy to the 
levee<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the levee was 
dry<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and 
rye<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin' this'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and there we were all in one 
place<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A generation lost in 
space<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time left to start 
again<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be 
quick<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Flash sat on a 
candlestick<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cause fire is the Devil's only 
friend<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and as I watched him on the 
stage<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hands were clenched in fists of 
rage<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No angel born in 
hell<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could break that Satan's 
spell<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the flames climbed high into the 
night<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To light the sacrificial 
rite<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw Satan laughing with 
delight<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the music 
died<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was singing bye-bye, Miss American 
Pie<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove my Chevy to the 
levee<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the levee was 
dry<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and 
rye<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin' this'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met a girl who sang the 
blues<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I asked her for some happy 
news<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she just smiled and turned 
away<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went down to the sacred 
store<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I'd heard the music years 
before<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the man there said the music wouldn't 
play<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the streets the children 
screamed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovers cried, and the poets 
dreamed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a word was 
spoken<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church bells all were 
broken<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the three men I admire 
most<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Father, Son and the Holy 
Ghost<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They caught the last train for the 
coast<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day the music 
died<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were singing bye-bye, Miss American 
Pie<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove my Chevy to the 
levee<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the levee was 
dry<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and 
rye<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin' this'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll be the day that I 
die<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were singing bye-bye, Miss American 
Pie<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove my Chevy to the 
levee<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the levee was 
dry<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and 
rye<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singin' this'll be the day that I die.</P>
