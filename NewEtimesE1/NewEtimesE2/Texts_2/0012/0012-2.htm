<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The World Economic Forum meeting ended this week in New York City. About 
two-thousand-seven-hundred heads of government, business leaders and members of 
non-governmental organizations met for five days. They announced programs meant 
to improve living conditions in Africa. They also discussed security and 
economic issues after the terrorist attacks on the United States. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Forum is a private, independent group of business and political leaders. 
Its aim is to improve economic growth and social progress throughout the world. 
For the past thirty-one years, it met in Davos, Switzerland. The conference was 
held in New York this year to show support for the city after the terrorist 
attacks. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">New York officials provided heavy security for the event. At one point, as 
many as seven-thousand demonstrators gathered. Many of them protested the 
opening of world markets for increased trade. They say easing trade restrictions 
harms workers. None of the demonstrations was as violent as at similar, past 
events in other cities. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the meeting, the Group of Seven industrial countries and Russia 
announced a five-hundred-million-dollar new project to help Africa. This project 
would aid African countries that create programs to improve trade and 
investments. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">American businessman Bill Gates and his wife Melinda head a 
private-assistance organization. Mister Gates told the Forum that the 
organization is giving fifty-million dollars to prevent H-I-V virus and AIDS 
disease in Africa. However, he said private gifts alone would not solve poor 
health and living conditions. Former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and 
activist musician Bono also discussed ways to improve health and living 
conditions. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Many delegates at the World Economic Forum were concerned about the slow 
world economy after the terrorist attacks in September. Some worried about the 
effects of the failure of the American energy company, Enron. They said the 
problems of the company could worsen the worldwide economy. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Most speakers praised the United States led campaign against terrorism in 
Afghanistan. However, some diplomats expressed concern that America might extend 
military action without seeking approval from other nations. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Porto Alegre, Brazil, forty-thousand people held a very different 
conference. The World Social Forum ended Tuesday. Delegates denounced United 
States military action and defense spending. They discussed ways to stop a Free 
Trade Area of the Americas. It was organized by the United States to provide a 
united trade area from Alaska to Argentina by Two-Thousand-Five. World Social 
Forum delegates said free trade agreements increase differences between rich and 
poor in the area. </font>
