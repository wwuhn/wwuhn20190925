<p style="text-align: center"><b><font size="4" face="Georgia">Major Economic 
Changes Ahead as US Baby Boomers Retire</font></b></p>     


<p>　<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The  baby boom generation, the 78 million born in the U.S. population 
 
________&nbsp; that followed World War II, are edging toward  retirement age. 
Analysts ________ their aging could generate some economic changes. It would 
not be the first ________ change brought about by the baby boomers. <br>
　Because of their  sheer size, Stanford economist John Shoven says, this 
________ has had a  profound effect on the U.S. economy at every ________ of 
development. &quot;In the 1950s, the schools were bursting and it was difficult to 
 
________ the baby boomers. In the 1970s, when they ________ the job market 
in large numbers, they  ________ the growth of wages.&quot; <br>
　And then, National Association of Realtors economist David Lereah notes, U.S. 
house ________ jumped 54 percent between 1980 and 1990, when the baby ________ generation went on a home buying  spree. &quot;It's not a  
________ that the 
stock market, the economy, the housing ________ have all achieved almost record 
levels in the 1990s and ________ into the 2000s because of the boomers,&quot; he says. 
&quot;They are ________ their peak earning years, and they have been the driving 
________ in the economy.&quot; <br>
　But what will happen as they ________ through those peak earning years? David Lereah 
________ national declines in consumer spending after 2009 and stock 
market ________ as well. He says, &quot;When you head toward retirement you 
________ to 
get more conservative, so there is a chance that there will be  ________ amounts of money that is taken out of stocks and 
________ into more conservative bond 
funds.&quot; <br>
　That could mean a decade of ________ stock prices. But according to David Lereah, 
there are ________ . Spending and stock buying by the increasingly large U.S. 
________ population could  offset that slide, for example. <br>
　For ________ John Shoven, the biggest variable is the health and  ________ of the baby boomers. &quot;This generation may be the first generation to 
________ from the  molecular medicine that is being ________ . So I think there is a 
very good chance that they will live ________ longer than their parents, 
and that will have consequences.&quot; <br>
What kinds of ________ ? That depends on how healthy they are. Will the baby 
boomers live longer ________ lives as wage earners? Or will they live longer 
as dependent, ________ citizens? The health of the U.S. ________ has a lot to do 
with the answer to those questions. </font>  </p>
