<p style="text-align: center"><b><font size="4" face="Georgia">Major Economic 
Changes Ahead as US Baby Boomers Retire</font></b></p>     


<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Linda Cashdan</font></p>     


<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　The  baby boom generation, the 78 million born in the U.S. population 
 
explosion that followed World War II, are edging toward  retirement age. 
Analysts anticipate their aging could generate some economic changes. It would 
not be the first economic change brought about by the baby boomers. </font></p>     


<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Because of their  sheer size, Stanford economist John Shoven says, this 
generation has had a  profound effect on the U.S. economy at every stage of 
development. &quot;In the 1950s, the schools were bursting and it was difficult to 
 
accommodate the baby boomers. In the 1970s, when they entered the job market 
in large numbers, they  depressed the growth of wages.&quot; </font></p>     


<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　And then, National Association of Realtors economist David Lereah notes, U.S. 
house prices jumped 54 percent between 1980 and 1990, when the baby boom 
generation went on a home buying  spree. &quot;It's not a  coincidence that the 
stock market, the economy, the housing markets have all achieved almost record 
levels in the 1990s and going into the 2000s because of the boomers,&quot; he says. 
&quot;They are entering their peak earning years, and they have been the driving 
force in the economy.&quot; </font></p>     


<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　But what will happen as they pass through those peak earning years? David 
Lereah predicts national declines in consumer spending after 2009 and stock 
market declines as well. He says, &quot;When you head toward retirement you tend to 
get more conservative, so there is a chance that there will be  significant 
amounts of money that is taken out of stocks and put into more conservative bond 
funds.&quot; </font></p>     


<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　That could mean a decade of lower stock prices. But according to David Lereah, 
there are variables. Spending and stock buying by the increasingly large U.S. 
immigrant population could  offset that slide, for example. </font></p>     


<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　For economist John Shoven, the biggest variable is the health and  longevity 
of the baby boomers. &quot;This generation may be the first generation to benefit 
from the  molecular medicine that is being developed. So I think there is a 
very good chance that they will live substantially longer than their parents, 
and that will have consequences.&quot; </font></p>     


<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">What kinds of consequences? That depends on how healthy they are. Will the baby 
boomers live longer productive lives as wage earners? Or will they live longer 
as dependent, elderly citizens? The health of the U.S. economy has a lot to do 
with the answer to those questions. Linda Cashdan, VOA news, Washington.</font></p>
