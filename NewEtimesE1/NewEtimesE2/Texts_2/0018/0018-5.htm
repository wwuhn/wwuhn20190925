<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">By Christiano Beardsley </font><p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Now the VOA special English program, explorations.
Today Larry

him by using the mathematical ________ of algebra and geometry." </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Uncle Jacob's ________ made a big difference in Albert's school work.

Albert solved all the problems
in his ________ book.

________ that he wanted to teach mathematics and physics. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein ________ the federal polytechnic institute in Zurich,
Switzerland.
He ________ with honors.
But he could not get a
________ job.
So he took a job in the Swiss ________ patent
Office.
The job was easy.
He had ________ of time to work on his
own ideas. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">________ of those ideas were about relativity.
</font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein had ________ to believe that everything in the universe was
________ .
Everything from the smallest electrons of an atom to the
________ planets and stars.
Measuring any of these movements
________ on where the measurer is standing. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">________ for a moment that you are driving a car.
</font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Your ________ , relative to the ground, is fifty ________ an hour.

An insect inside the ________ with you flies from the back of the ________ to the front.
Relative to you, the ________ is flying ten
kilometers an hour.
But to someone ________ at the side of the
road, the insect's ________ would be sixty kilometers an hour. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">________ you and the insect are traveling, the ________ is moving at
thirty kilometers a second ________ to the sun.
And the sun is
________ at two-hundred-forty kilometers a ________ relative to the
center of our milky way ________ . </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein said that the speed of ________ -- three-hundred-thousand
kilometers a second -- ________ changes.
It does not matter where
the ________ is coming from, or who is ________ its speed.
It is
always the same.
________ , time can change.
And mass can change.

And ________ can change. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Let us use our imagination again. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Imagine two ________ with a scientist in each.
One spaceship
is red.
One is ________ .
Except for color, both spaceships are
________ alike.
They pass each other far out in ________ . </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Neither scientist feels that his ship is ________ .
To each, it
seems the other ship is ________ , not his.
As they pass at high
speed, the ________ in each ship measures how long it takes a
________ of light to travel from the floor to the ________ of his
spaceship, hit a mirror, and ________ to the floor.
Both
spaceships have a ________ that lets each scientist watch the
________ of the other. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">At exactly the same ________ , they begin their experiments.
The
scientist in the blue ________ sees his beam of light go ________ up
and come straight down.
But he ________ that the light beam in the
red ship ________ not do this. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Because the red ship is ________ so fast, the beam does not appear
to go ________ up.
It goes up at an angle and comes ________ at an
angle.
It forms a path that ________ like an upside down "v". </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This path is ________ than the straight up-and-down path that the
________ scientist saw in his own ship.
Because light ________ at the
same speed, time would have to ________ more slowly in the red ship
to ________ the light beam travel the longer path. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The ________ in the red ship would see ________ the same thing as
he watched the ________ by the blue scientist.
He would say
________ time passed more slowly in the ________ ship.

would be correct, because the ________ of time is relative.
Each
would be ________ in saying that the other ship had ________ time. </font>
<p>

It would ________ to get heavier. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">These are difficult ideas to ________ .

<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ten years ________ his paper on the special theory of ________ ,

his "general theory of relativity." It ________ new ideas about
gravity, and about the ________ relationship between matter and
energy. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein said matter could be ________ into energy.
He developed
a simple mathematical ________ that measured the amount of
Energy in ________ .
It is: "e equals mc squared." </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">"e" is the energy in a ________ of matter.
"m" is the mass of the
matter.
"c ________ " is the speed of light, ________ by itself. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This statement, or formula, ________ the great amount of energy
that could come ________ a tiny piece of matter.
It explained how the ________ could give off heat and light for ________ of years.

Einstein's formula also ________ to the discovery of atomic energy. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein ________ a Nobel prize in physics in the ________ Nineteen-twenty-one.
He received the ________ -- not for his
theories of relativity -- but for his ________ of the law of the
photoelectric ________ .
This law explained how and why some ________ give off electrons after light falls on 
________ surfaces.
This
discovery led to the development of ________ electronics, including
radio and television. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein ________ a famous man.
But he had few close friends. "It 
is ________ ," he wrote, "to be known by so many and yet to be so
________ ." he was a man who saw god in ________ .
"what I see in nature," said Einstein, "is something ________ that we understand only imperfectly."
</font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein ________ Germany when Adolph Hitler came to ________ in

He said he ________ stay in a country only
where there was ________ liberty, toleration and equality of all
________ under law. </font>
<p>

He
worked at the institute for ________ study in Princeton, New
Jersey. </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Einstein spent the ________ twenty-five years of his life working on
what he ________ the unified field theory.
He hoped to ________ a common mathematical statement that could ________ together all the
different fields of ________ . </font>
<p>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It was work that Einstein ________ completed.
In
Nineteen-fifty-five, Albert Einstein died.
