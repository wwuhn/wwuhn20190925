<p style="text-align: center"><b><font face="Georgia" size="4">Traditional Business 
Owners Back to Tech School</font></b></p>     
<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Linda Cashdan</font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Technology is changing so quickly today that small, traditional business owners 
need to understand computers,  finance, electronic  commerce, and  upscale 
marketing techniques just to stay alive. A masters program in technology 
management at the University of Pennsylvania teaches both technical and 
managerial expertise. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Spokesman Lyle Ungar says the program is designed for managers who have been 
out in the world of business five or 10 years and realize in today's market they 
must  broaden their knowledge. &quot;All of a sudden you want to have this broader 
understanding,&quot; he says. &quot;You need to market the thing you are designing, need 
to talk to the  accountants about getting money for it, need to do an 
environmental  impact study, but you are not trained as an environmental 
engineer.&quot; </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　The fact is, Mr. Ungar says, the smallest, simplest businesses have become very 
complicated. Take  grocery stores, for example. Thanks to the advent of the 
computer, he says, storeowners must gather data in order to sell their 
 
merchandise effectively. &quot;They are keeping tremendously detailed track of who 
is coming in, who is buying what, which products last, how long the  shelf 
life, what should I be selling, where should I be advertising? That is data,&quot; he 
says. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Student Christian Stein owns six gas stations. He says the knowledge he 
acquired in a micro-electronics course at the school enabled him to select new 
gasoline pumps and underground monitoring equipment. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Inspired by a database management course, he says, he installed web cameras 
and a computer network. &quot;We have around 50-employees, so there is a lot of room 
for errors,&quot; he says. &quot;So by just putting simple things in place, for example, all 
our stations have state-of-the-art computer systems in them, we were able to 
 
eliminate a massive amount of time that was spent on paper work.&quot; </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Trucking company owner Steve Rozman developed a system to track in-transit 
 
inventory for his clients after taking the school's electronic commerce 
course. &quot;The one thing you can be certain about is that there is going to be 
continual change out there,&quot; he says. &quot;So if you are not trying to change and 
constantly apply technology to business, you are almost guaranteed to lose.&quot; </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　That  philosophy is driving many a business owner back to school these days.</font></p>
