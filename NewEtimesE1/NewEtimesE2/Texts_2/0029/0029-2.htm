<p style="text-align: center"><b><font face="Georgia" size="4">WTO Chief: China's Entry a 
Defining Moment</font></b></p>     

<p style="text-align: center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">by Kate Pound Dawson</font></p>     

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　The World Trade Organization's director general says China's entry into the 
World Trade Organization was a defining moment for Asia. Speaking in Hong Kong, 
Mike Moore said the action, which took place at the WTO meeting earlier this 
month in Doha, will have long-lasting effects on world trade. </font> </p>     

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　The World Trade Organization chief says as a result of its entry into WTO, 
China is now&nbsp; committed to developing a modern&nbsp; legal system and at 
the same time has obtained secure markets for its exports. Mike Moore adds 
having China's huge economy and growing economic might in the WTO will change 
the outlook for international trade. &quot;It would have been worth going to Doha 
just to have China as a member,&quot; he said. &quot;This changes the world, this changes 
everything.&quot;</font></p>     

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　Mr. Moore, who spoke at Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents Club, warned Beijing 
may face tough challenges as it makes economic changes to meet membership 
requirements. And, Mr. Moore said, China may initially be uncomfortable with the 
body's system for settling disputes. But he says he is convinced Beijing will do 
the work needed, because it wants to be a fully engaged member of the world 
community. &quot;I believe the Chinese leadership wants this thing to work,&quot; said 
Mike Moore. &quot;The first dispute will be interesting, but the whole world will be 
watching.&quot;</font></p>     

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　Mr. Moore said the WTO's meeting earlier this month in Doha will eventually 
bring major changes to world trade. For the first time, developing countries in 
the WTO were unified in pressing their key concerns, such as access to 
medicines. </font> </p>     

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　Perhaps even more significant, Mr. Moore said, is that the members committed 
the WTO to talks on eliminating farm&nbsp; subsidies. Agriculture subsidies by 
the big members, the United States and the European Union, have long been an&nbsp; 
irritant in the developing world. Mr. Moore said phasing them out would&nbsp; 
dramatically improve farm exports for some poor nations, while making food 
imports cheaper for other countries.</font></p>     

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　Mr. Moore said the WTO now is working on helping Russia join. Mr. Moore said 
the Russian government understands what needs to be done to prepare for 
membership and that it could enter as early as 2003. But, he said, the timing 
depends on how quickly individual WTO members complete their negotiations with 
Moscow. </font> </p>
