Being Tourist-Friendly</b></font></p>

<p>　It is another typical morning in  Times Square: Taxi cabs  ________ their 
 
horns, 15-meter-tall  billboards look down over  ________ of people hurrying 
by, and in the middle of it all, members of a smash  Broadway ________ climb 
up on a stage to dance and sing for the ________ . <br>
　The Times Square Visitors Center, 1560 Broadway, between 46th &amp; 47th Sts. The 
 
________ is being organized by the Times Square Business Improvement 
District, the people ________ for making the area as ________ to tourists as 
possible. Right now, the square is crowded and ________ is booming. So much 
so, in fact, that several sidewalks had to be ________ recently to cope with 
the increase in ________ . And some New Yorkers are even pushing for the 
________ area to be off limits to traffic: modeling Times Square after a 
________ plaza. <br>
　It has not always been this way. Until a ________ or so ago, Times Square had the 
well-deserved reputation of a ________ neighborhood teeming with prostitutes and 
________ dealers. A sizeable part of the area's economy came 
from ________ selling&nbsp; pornography or cheap knock-off goods. The city 
government  ________ the area, spending little of its tourism ________ on 
improvements. <br>
　But today, theaters, restaurants and ________ stores have replaced the sex 
shops. A thriving ________ between City Hall and private businesses, such as 
Disney Company, has  ________ Times Square.<br>
　The current mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, has made it a ________ to 
clean up the area. Crime rates have ________ and visitors feel a lot ________ on 
the square. Part of that effort has ________ the Times Square Business 
Improvement ________ and its President, Brendan Sexton.<br>
　&quot;Most people are glad ________ what has happened in Times Square and how 
great the 
 
________ of Times Square has been,&quot; he says. &quot;But we've never really 
________ ourselves. We get advertised because people ________ us. So we invented 
a line of  ________ that says 'Times Square' and 'Times Square Business 
Improvement District' to say 'Hey this is what we're ________ about ourselves.'&quot;<br>
　Mr. Sexton and his ________ are launching a new line of Times Square clothing 
and ________ which, they hope, will compete with everything else on offer to 
________ to New York. Instead of just passing ________ Times Square and stopping 
only to take a picture of all the ________ lights and neon signs, Mr. Sexton 
hopes tourists will stop and shop, and ________ a little piece of the revitalized 
Times Square home with them.<br>
