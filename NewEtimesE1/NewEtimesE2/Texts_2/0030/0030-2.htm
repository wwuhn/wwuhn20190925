Being Tourist-Friendly</b></font></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">by Owen Fay</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　It is another typical morning in  Times Square: Taxi cabs  blare their 
 
horns, 50-foot  billboards look down over  throngs of people hurrying 
by, and in the middle of it all, members of a smash  Broadway musical climb 
up on a stage to dance and sing for the tourists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　[The Times Square Visitors Center, 1560 Broadway, between 46th &amp; 47th Sts.] The 
 
entertainment is being organized by the Times Square Business Improvement 
District, the people responsible for making the area as welcoming to tourists as 
possible. Right now, the square is crowded and business is booming so much 
so, in fact, that several sidewalks had to be widened recently to cope with 
the increase in visitors. And some New Yorkers are even pushing for the entire 
area to be off limits to traffic: modeling Times Square after a European  plaza. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　It has not always been this way. Until a decade or so ago, Times Square had the 
well-deserved reputation of a seedy neighborhood  teeming with  prostitutes and drug  dealers. A sizeable part of the area's economy came 
from stores selling&nbsp; pornography or cheap knock-off goods. The city 
government  neglected the area, spending little of its tourism budget on 
improvements. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　But today, theaters, restaurants and upscale stores have replaced the sex 
shops. A thriving partnership between City Hall and private businesses, such as 
Disney Company, has  revitalized Times Square.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　The current mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, has made it a priority to 
clean up the area. Crime rates have declined and visitors feel a lot safer on 
the square. Part of that effort has involved the Times Square Business 
Improvement District and its President, Brendan Sexton.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　&quot;Most people are glad about what has happened in Times Square and how great the 
 
revival of Times Square has been,&quot; he says. &quot;But we've never really 
advertised ourselves. We get advertised because people notice us. So we invented 
a line of  merchandise that says 'Times Square' and 'Times Square Business 
Improvement District' to say 'Hey, you know, this is what we're saying about ourselves.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">　Mr. Sexton and his colleagues are launching a new line of Times Square clothing 
and accessories which, they hope, will compete with everything else on offer to 
visitors to New York. Instead of just passing through Times Square and stopping 
only to take a picture of all the flashing lights and neon signs, Mr. Sexton 
hopes tourists will stop and shop, and bring a little piece of the revitalized 
Times Square home with them.</font></p>
