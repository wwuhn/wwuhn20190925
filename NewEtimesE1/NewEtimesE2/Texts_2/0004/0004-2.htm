<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes in the month of November, a special event happens in the sky that 
observers may remember for a lifetime. The event is more than a meteor shower. 
It is a meteor storm. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Meteors are pieces of rock from space that burn up in our atmosphere. Meteor 
showers happen when the Earth passes through a large amount of space material 
during its orbit around the sun. However, thousands of meteors fall during a 
meteor storm. Some of them may briefly shine brighter than any star in the sky.
</font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Leonid (LEE-oh-nid) meteor shower happens every November. In most years, 
it is not unusual. Leonid meteors fall at an average rate of only fifteen each 
hour. However, every thirty-three years an object passes through our solar 
system that changes the Leonid meteor shower. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A comet is a large body of gas, ice and rock. Comets leave behind these 
materials as they orbit the sun. Each year around November Eighteenth, the Earth 
passes through material left behind by a comet called Tempel-Tuttle. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In February of Nineteen-Ninety-Eight, comet Tempel-Tuttle returned to the 
inner solar system. Astronomers have found that the Leonid meteor shower can 
become very active for about five years after the appearance of that comet.
</font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Astronomers also have discovered that each appearance of comet Tempel-Tuttle 
leaves behind a different path of material. This discovery has permitted 
astronomers to know when the Leonid meteor shower may be most intense. Some 
astronomers believe the Leonids this month may be a meteor storm. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Eighteen-Thirty-Three, observers in the eastern United States saw an 
intense meteor storm. One person estimated that meteors fell at a rate of 
ten-thousand an hour above West Point, New York. In Nineteen-Sixty-Six, people 
in the western United States saw another intense Leonid meteor storm. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This year, astronomers believe that there will be two periods of heavy meteor 
activity starting on November Eighteenth. At Ten Hours Universal Time, observers 
in North America should see a large number of meteors. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Another period of meteor activity should happen at about Eighteen Hours 
Universal Time. Observers in east Asia and western Australia will see it best. 
Astronomers who have researched the Leonids say the best chance to see a meteor 
storm may be this year and next year. </font>
