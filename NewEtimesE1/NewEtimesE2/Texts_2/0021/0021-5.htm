Provide Function and Fashion</font></p>         

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Do your socks tell you when they need cleaning? Can your shirt change 
color? Is your neck tie ________ your blood pressure? Such possibilities are 
not ________
off. U.S.  electronics,  textile, and chemical manufacturers are all ________
to create clothes that provide ________
as well as fashion. <br>
　Dupont Corporation spokesman Stacey Burr sees the ________
to design &quot;smart&quot; 
 
fabrics as just the next ________
in the historic evolution of ________
. First, 
she says, Dupont worked with natural ________
like wool and silk. Then there was 
the ________
of man made fibers like ________
, and  polyester. <br>
　Next, she says, Dupont ________
&quot;partially active&quot; fibers like  Lycra and ________
, materials that stretched and ________
to conform to a person's body ________
. <br>
　&quot;What we're really talking ________
now is moving into a different ________
of active 
fibers, fibers that have the ________
, when they are manipulated with ________
impulses to have different ________
,&quot; Ms. Burr explains. &quot;Some of those ________
might be lending heating or cooling to the ________
that they're in. 
They may have ________
sensing capabilities.&quot; <br>
　She says the ________
is fueled by the fact that electronic ________
are 
becoming tinier and ________
. <br>
　&quot;Everything is becoming smaller, ________
and chips in particular. These are 
things we're looking at in very small ________
to be incorporated into  apparel 
and ________
,&quot; she says. <br>
　And they are not alone. Electronics ________
are trying to develop smart ________
too, as are a host of start-ups. <br>
　Take Sensatex, for example. ________
Jeff Wolf says Sensatex was set up ________
to produce a T-shirt capable of monitoring everything from the 
wearer's heart ________
to the number of  calories an ________
is burning. <br>
　&quot;We are focused on ________
the shirt as a platform to  garner ________
from any sensor on your body and to move this information ________
anywhere 
you need it to the Internet,&quot; he explains, &quot;to a ________
on your wrist, or to a ________
.&quot; <br>
　Such information could be used by ________
coaches, Mr. Wolf says, or by 
doctors ________
elderly patients. Sensatex ________
on having its first &quot;smart 
shirt&quot; on the market by the ________
of 2002. <br>
　&quot;And this will be a health and ________
product designed to monitor our daily 
activities, to ________
a certain person's vital ________
at any given time,&quot; he 
says. <br>
　We will expect the ________
of tomorrow to do more than just cover bodies, Mr. 
Wolf says. We will ________
them to perform essential tasks.</font></p>
