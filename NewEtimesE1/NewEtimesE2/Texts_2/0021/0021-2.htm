Provide Function and Fashion</font></p>         

<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Linda Cashdan</font></p>         

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Do your  socks tell you when they need cleaning? Can your shirt change 
color? Is your neck tie monitoring your  blood pressure? Such possibilities are 
not far off. U.S.  electronics,  textile, and chemical manufacturers are all 
striving to create clothes that provide function as well as fashion. <br>
<br>
　Dupont Corporation spokesman Stacey Burr sees the effort to design &quot;smart&quot; 
 
fabrics as just the next stage in the historic evolution of material. First, 
she says, Dupont worked with natural fibers like wool and silk. Then there was 
the invention of man made fibers like  nylon, and  polyester. <br>
<br>
　Next, she says, Dupont developed &quot;partially active&quot; fibers like  Lycra and spandex, materials that stretched and contracted to conform to a person's body 
shape. <br>
<br>
　&quot;What we're really talking about now is moving into a different realm of active 
fibers, fibers that have the ability, when they are manipulated with electric 
 
impulses to have different responses,&quot; Ms. Burr explains. &quot;Some of those 
responses might be lending heating or cooling to the fabric that they're in. 
They may have different sensing capabilities.&quot; <br>
<br>
　She says the trend is fueled by the fact that electronic components are 
becoming tinier and tinier. <br>
<br>
　&quot;Everything is becoming smaller,  circuits and chips in particular. These are 
things we're looking at in very small form to be incorporated into  apparel 
and textiles,&quot; she says. <br>
<br>
　And they are not alone. Electronics firms are trying to develop smart clothes 
too, as are a host of start-ups. <br>
<br>
　Take Sensatex, for example. Spokesman Jeff Wolf says Sensatex was set up 
specifically to produce a T-shirt capable of monitoring everything from the 
wearer's heart rate to the number of  calories an exerciser is burning. <br>
<br>
　&quot;We are focused on utilizing the shirt as a platform to  garner information 
from any sensor on your body and to move this information wirelessly anywhere 
you need it to the Internet,&quot; he explains, &quot;to a watch on your wrist, or to a 
computer.&quot; <br>
<br>
　Such information could be used by athletic coaches, Mr. Wolf says, or by 
doctors monitoring elderly patients. Sensatex plans on having its first &quot;smart 
shirt&quot; on the market by the middle of 2002. <br>
<br>
　&quot;And this will be a health and fitness product designed to monitor our daily 
activities, to determine a certain person's vital signs at any given time,&quot; he 
says. <br>
<br>
　We will expect the clothes of tomorrow to do more than just cover bodies, Mr. 
Wolf says. We will expect them to perform essential tasks.</font></p>
