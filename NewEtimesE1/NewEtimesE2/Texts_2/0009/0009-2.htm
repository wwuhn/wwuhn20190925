<b>&nbsp;</b></font><b><font face="Georgia" size="4"> Testing Possible Treatments for CJD
</font></b> </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font face="Times New Roman"><I><font size="4">By Nancy 
Steinbach</font></I><font size="4"> </font></font> </p>
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is Bill White with the VOA Special English Science Report.
</font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">American scientists say that two drugs have shown to be effective against the 
protein thought to cause the deadly brain condition Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 
or CJD. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">CJD causes holes to develop in the brain. It is rare, and cannot be cured. It 
usually affects people sixty-five years old or older. More than one-hundred 
people in Europe have died or are dying from it. Most of the victims live in 
Britain. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">These victims suffer a kind of CJD linked to the cattle sickness known as Mad 
Cow Disease. Its real name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. 
Scientists believe that eating infected beef from a cow suffering BSE is one 
cause of CJD. The infectious proteins are thought to damage healthy proteins and 
cause holes in the brain. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The American researchers reported the results of their recent work in "The 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences." The researchers are from the 
University of California at San Francisco. They say their research shows that 
two drugs can clear the infectious proteins from mouse brain cells. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The drugs are quinacrine and chlorpromazine. Quinacrine was used in the 
Nineteen-Forties to treat malaria. Chlorpromazine is used to treat the mental 
disorder schizophrenia. Quinacrine appears to be more effective in stopping the 
deadly protein activity. However, chlorpromazine crosses more easily into the 
brain. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The researchers in San Francisco already have treated two CJD patients with 
the drugs. One patient is British. The other patient is American. The results 
are not clear, although a British newspaper has reported improvement in one of 
the patients. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The researchers are preparing to test the drugs in more people to see if they 
are effective against CJD. This process will begin next month. The patients will 
go to the university hospital for two weeks of treatment with one or both drugs. 
They will continue taking the drugs for another six months at home. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The study will try to find the correct amount of each drug to use. And it 
will measure how much of each drug gets into the patients' brains. The treatment 
will be considered successful if patients survive longer and are able to take 
part in daily activities of normal living. </font>
