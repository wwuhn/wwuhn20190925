　<font face="Georgia" size="4"><b>'Geocaching' As Sport</b></font><P style="text-align: center">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Linda Cashdan</font><P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Sales of Global Positioning Systems, navigational devices that use radio 
signals from satellites to determine locations, are on the rise in the United 
States. GPS navigation equipment owes its  newfound  popularity to both 
 
conventional and unconventional users.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Auto manufacturers are putting them in  upscale car models and  predict the 
navigation tools will soon be as common in automobiles as radios are today. 
Pilots and boaters are using them, and so are a growing number of treasure 
hunters.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　That's because the navigation devices have given rise to a new sport called &quot;Geocaching&quot;, 
where people hide treasures or &quot;caches&quot; and then post the treasure's GPS 
 
coordinates at a the web site &quot;Geocaching.com.&quot;
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;You go to the web site and it will tell you the caches that are in the [your] 
area,&quot; said Jeremy Irish, who set up the web site. &quot;And then you just click on 
each cache page and there's a  longitudinal and  latitude listing that gives 
you the location of the cache. And you just enter that in your GPS unit and get 
in your car or go on foot or by bike and get to the cache.&quot;</font><P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Amazingly, more than 30,000 people in 59 countries around the world are 
doing just that.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　The treasures, things like toys or CDs or  trinkets, are provided by those 
who plant the caches. Ardent geocacher Jon Stanley has both planted treasures 
and searched for some.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;Working in a tech field, I was attracted by the electronics, and I've always 
been fascinated by the outdoors and maps,&quot; he said. &quot;It's that primal urge to go 
out into the unknown and try to find a point that's showing up on your GPS.&quot;</font><P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Jon Stanley gives into that &quot;primal&quot; urge as many weekends as he can.</font><P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;For me the peak of excitement is actually, physically seeing it,&quot; he said. 
&quot;I don't care too much what is in the cache. For me, it's the hunt.&quot;</font><P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Like Jon Stanley and other geocaching enthusiasts, web site creator Jeremy 
Irish earns his living in a field unrelated to geocaching.
</font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;Some of the people who sell Global Positioning Systems from the web site help 
to pay for some of the equipment I use to run the web site, but otherwise, it's 
just a hobby for me right now,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't want to jeopardize the sport 
itself by over-commercializing it.&quot;</font><P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Created by a U.S. military program, the Global Positioning System seems to have 
given rise unexpectedly to a new sport.<br>
