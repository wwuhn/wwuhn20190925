Analyst Predicts Rebound in US Equities</b></font></p>     
<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Michael Drudge</font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　One of America's leading stock market analysts, Abby Joseph Cohen, is 
forecasting a  rebound in U.S. equities in the later half of 2002. Ms. Cohen 
spoke in London. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Abby Joseph Cohen has become one of the most influential analysts of U.S. 
stocks through her position as chief global strategist for the New York-based 
investment bank, Goldman Sachs. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　She is predicting that a year from now, the benchmark Standard and Poor's index 
of America's 500 biggest companies will be 15 to 25 percent higher. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Ms. Cohen said the September 11 terrorist attacks dealt what she called &quot;a very 
significant blow&quot; to the U.S. economy. But she said those who bought stocks 
right afterward have made money. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Ms. Cohen said in the short term, U.S. companies have more bad news to report, 
but things should improve next year. &quot;Most investors in the United States 
believe, as we do, that this recession is already showing some signs of 
stabilization,&quot; she said. &quot;And that we do think that the economic data will 
start turning positive in the spring and by the second half of 2002, we should 
have some very good news from U.S. corporate America.&quot; </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Ms. Cohen says in her forecast that the U.S. economic rebound will be led by 
technology companies, manufacturers, financial services, and energy firms. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　The chief of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, Jim O'Neil, said he 
expects another half-point decline in interest rates both in the United States 
and Europe between now and February. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　He said lower rates already are helping to improve next year's economic 
outlook. &quot;Luckily, as a result of monetary and&nbsp; fiscal policy, primarily in 
the U.S., but also the same aggressive response elsewhere, we think by the 
second quarter we will be out of it, and things will be looking healthier,  
considerably healthier, in the United States and in Europe,&quot; he said. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Mr. O'Neil remains pessimistic about Japan, however, saying it is almost a 
&quot;hopeless case.&quot; He said there is considerable talk about&nbsp; devaluing the 
Japanese yen to help increase exports and stimulate the long-stagnant 
Japanese economy. <br>
