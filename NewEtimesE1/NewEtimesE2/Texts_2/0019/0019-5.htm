<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">By KATHERINE CLARKE
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I'm Shirley Griffith. <br>
And I'm Ray Freeman. Every week we tell about a person who
was important in the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> of the United States. This week we
tell <span lang="en-us">_______</span> Helen Keller. She was blind and deaf 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> she became a
famous writer and teacher. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The name Helen Keller has had <span lang="en-us">_______</span> meaning for millions of
people in all <span lang="en-us">_______</span> of the world. She could not see or hear.
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> Helen Keller was able to do so 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> with her days and years.
Her success gave <span lang="en-us">_______</span> hope.
Helen Keller was born June twenty-seventh, eighteen-eighty in a
small <span lang="en-us">_______</span> in northern Alabama. Her father, Arthur Keller, was a
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> in the army of the south during the American 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> war.
Her mother was his second <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . She was much younger than her
husband. Helen was <span lang="en-us">_______</span> first child.
Until she was a year-and-one half old, Helen Keller was <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> like
any other child. She was very <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . She began walking and
talking early. Then, nineteen <span lang="en-us">_______</span> after she was born, Helen
became very sick. It was a <span lang="en-us">_______</span> sickness that made her
completely blind and <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . The doctor could not do anything for
her. Her <span lang="en-us">_______</span> , happy world now was filled with 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> and
darkness. </font> </p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">From that time until she was almost <span lang="en-us">_______</span> years old, Helen could
communicate only by making <span lang="en-us">_______</span> with her hands. But she learned
how to be <span lang="en-us">_______</span> in her silent, dark environment.
The young <span lang="en-us">_______</span> had strong desires. She knew what she wanted to
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> . No one could stop her from 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> it.
More and more, she wanted to communicate <span lang="en-us">_______</span> others. Making
simple signs with her <span lang="en-us">_______</span> was not enough. Something was ready
to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> inside of her because she could not make 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> understand her. She screamed and 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> when her mother tried
to control her. </font> </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When Helen was six, her father <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> about a doctor in Baltimore, Maryland. The <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> had successfully treated people
who were <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . Helen's parents took her on the 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> to
Baltimore. But the doctor said he could do <span lang="en-us">_______</span> to help
Helen. He suggested the Kellers <span lang="en-us">_______</span> a teacher for the blind who
could teach Helen to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> .
A teacher arrived from the Perkins institution for the <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> in
Boston. Her name was Anne Sullivan. She herself had <span lang="en-us">_______</span> been
almost completely blind. But she had <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her sight. At
Perkins, she had learned the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> methods of teaching the
blind. </font> </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Anne Sullivan began by <span lang="en-us">_______</span> Helen that everything had a name.
The secret to the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> was the letters that formed them. The
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> was long and difficult. Helen had to 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> how to use her
hands and fingers to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> for her. But she was not yet 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> to
learn. First, she had to be taught how to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> , and how to
control her anger. Miss Sullivan was <span lang="en-us">_______</span> to understand this.
She wrote to friends in Boston <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her experiences
teaching Helen. </font> </p>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The first <span lang="en-us">_______</span> I arrived I gave Helen a doll. As she felt the
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> with one hand I slowly formed the letters, d-o-l-l with my
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> in her other hand.
Helen looked in wonder and <span lang="en-us">_______</span> as she felt my hand. Then
she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> the letters in my hand just as I had 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> in hers.
She was quick to learn, but she was <span lang="en-us">_______</span> quick in anger. For
seven years, no one had <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her self-control. Instead of
continuing to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> she picked up the doll and threw it on the
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> .
She was this way in almost everything she did. Even at the
table, while eating, she did exactly as she pleased. She even
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> her hands in our plates and <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> our food.
The second morning, I would not <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her put her hand on my plate.
The <span lang="en-us">_______</span> became troubled and left the room. I 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> the door
and continued to eat.
Helen was on the floor, kicking and <span lang="en-us">_______</span> and trying to pull
the chair <span lang="en-us">_______</span> from under me. This continued for half an 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> or
so. Then she got up <span lang="en-us">_______</span> the floor and came to find 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> what I
was doing. Suddenly she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> me. Every time she did this I 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> her hand.
After a few minutes of this, she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> to her place at the table
and <span lang="en-us">_______</span> to eat with her fingers. I gave her a 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> to eat
with. She threw it on the floor. I <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her to get out of her
chair to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> the spoon up.
At last, after two hours, she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> down and ate like other people.
I had to teach her to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . But it was painful to her family to
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> their deaf and blind child <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> . So I asked them to let
me move with Helen <span lang="en-us">_______</span> a small one room house nearby. The 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> day Helen was away from her family she kicked and 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> most
of the time. That night I could not <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her get into bed. We
struggled, but I <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her down on the bed. Luckily I was
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> than she.
The next morning I expected more of the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> , but to my surprise
she was calm, <span lang="en-us">_______</span> peaceful. Two weeks later she had become a
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> child. She was ready to learn.
My job now was <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . Helen learned quickly. Now I could
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> and shape her intelligence. We spent all day 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> . I
formed words in her hand, the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> of everything we touched.
But she had no <span lang="en-us">_______</span> what the words meant.
As time passed, she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> how to sew clothes and make things.
Every day we <span lang="en-us">_______</span> the farm animals and searched for eggs in
the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> houses. All the time, I was busy 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> letters and
words in her hand <span lang="en-us">_______</span> my fingers.
Then one day, about a month after I <span lang="en-us">_______</span> , we were walking
outside. Something important <span lang="en-us">_______</span> .
We heard someone pumping water. I put Helen's <span lang="en-us">_______</span> under the
cool water and formed the word w-a-t-e-r in her <span lang="en-us">_______</span> hand.
W-a-t-e-r, w-a-t-e-r. I formed the word again and again in her
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> . Helen looked straight up at the 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> as if a lost memory or
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> of some kind was coming back to her. Suddenly, the 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> mystery of language seemed clear to her.
I could <span lang="en-us">_______</span> that the word w-a-t-e-r meant something 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> and
cool, that flowed over her hand. The word became <span lang="en-us">_______</span> for her.
It awakened her spirit gave it <span lang="en-us">_______</span> and hope. She ran toward
the house. I ran after her. One by one she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> things and
asked their name. I told her. She went on <span lang="en-us">_______</span> for names and
more names.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">From that time on Helen <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> the house each day, searching <span lang="en-us">_______</span> things to 
learn. Each new name brought new thoughts. Everything
she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> seemed alive.
One day, Helen remembered a doll she had <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . She searched
everywhere for the pieces. She tried to put the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> together
but could not. She understood <span lang="en-us">_______</span> she had done and was not
happy.
Miss Sullivan <span lang="en-us">_______</span> Helen many things -- to read and write, and
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> to use a typewriter. But most important, she 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> Helen
how to think.
For the <span lang="en-us">_______</span> three years, Helen learned more and more 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> words.
All day <span lang="en-us">Miss</span> Sullivan kept <span lang="en-us">_______</span> Helen's hand, 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> words
that gave Helen a language. In time, Helen <span lang="en-us">_______</span> she could
learn foreign languages. She learned <span lang="en-us">_______</span> , Greek, French, and
German.
Helen was able to <span lang="en-us">_______</span> many things, not just languages. She was
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> willing to leave a problem <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> , even difficult
problems in mathematics. One time, <span lang="en-us">Miss</span> Sullivan suggested
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> a problem to solve until the 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> day. But Helen wanted
to keep trying. She said, &quot;I think it will make my mind <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> to do it now.&quot;
Helen traveled a lot with her <span lang="en-us">_______</span> or alone with 
<span lang="en-us">Miss</span> Sullivan.
In eighteen-eighty-eight, Helen, her <span lang="en-us">_______</span> and
<span lang="en-us">Miss</span> Sullivan
went to Boston, Massachusetts. They <span lang="en-us">_______</span> the Perkins
institution where <span lang="en-us">Miss</span> Sullivan had <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> to teach.
They stayed for most of the summer at the home of family <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> near the Atlantic <span lang="en-us">Ocean</span>. In Helen's first 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> with the
ocean she was caught by a <span lang="en-us">_______</span> and pulled under the water. Miss
Sullivan <span lang="en-us">_______</span> her. When Helen recovered, she demanded, &quot;<span lang="en-us">W</span>ho
put <span lang="en-us">_______</span> in the water<span lang="en-us">?</span>&quot;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Three years after Helen <span lang="en-us">
_______</span> to communicate with her hands,
she <span lang="en-us">_______</span> to learn to speak as other 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> did. She never
forgot these days. <span lang="en-us">_______</span> in life, she wrote: &quot;<span lang="en-us">N</span>o deaf child can
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> forget the excitement of his first 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> . Only one who is
deaf can <span lang="en-us">_______</span> the loving way I talked to my 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> , to the
stones, to birds and <span lang="en-us">_______</span> . Only the deaf can understand how I
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> when my dog obeyed my spoken 
<span lang="en-us">_______</span> .&quot;
Those first days when Helen Keller <span lang="en-us">_______</span> the ability to talk
were wonderful. But they <span lang="en-us">_______</span> to be just the beginning of her
many successes. </font> </p>
