<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">American and Indian scientists say new evidence ________ that India and nearby countries are in danger of 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>a huge earthquake in the future. </font>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A recent study ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>rock activity and pressure under the Himalayan Mountains 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>the Tibetan plateau.
The researchers say there is evidence that ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>pressure has been eased in the past only 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>great earthquakes. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Researchers from the University of Colorado ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>the Indian Institute for Astrophysics reported the 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>in the publication "Science." They say the pressures in the 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>under the ground will continue to increase as the 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>pushes into Asia.
Scientists say the land is moving ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>two meters every one-hundred years.
This continued ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>of rock against rock causes many small 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>. </font>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">One researcher says parts of the Himalayas ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>not had a major earthquake for at 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>five-hundred years.
The last major Himalayan earthquake ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>place in the Indian state of Assam in Nineteen-Fifty.
It ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>eight point five on the Richter Scale.
It ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>one of the most powerful earthquakes ever 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>.
The new study says another similar earthquake in the area ________<span lang="zh-cn">
</span>threaten about fifty-million people.
That is because the ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>of people in the Ganges plain just 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>of the mountains has grown ten times in the 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>one-hundred years.
Such an earthquake would ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>major cities in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>say at least two-hundred-thousand people might 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>in such an earthquake. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The researchers say the ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>in those countries need to strengthen buildings to 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>for the possibility of such an event.
They ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>new earthquake-resistant building designs should be taken very 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>. </font>
<P>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">They also say that it appears the changes ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>to strengthen buildings have not reduced the number of 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>killed in a major earthquake.
For example, the ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>in the western Indian city of Bhuj in 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>killed about twenty-thousand people.
That earthquake also ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>caused by the earth's movement.
But it did ________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>to ease the pressure hundreds of kilometers to the north and 
________<span lang="zh-cn"> </span>that could produce an even stronger earthquake.
