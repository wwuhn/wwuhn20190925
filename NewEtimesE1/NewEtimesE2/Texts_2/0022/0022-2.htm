Global Websites</b></font></p>     
<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Nick Simeone</font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Internet users around the world are being warned to take  precautions 
against what could be the most crippling computer virus to  infect the World 
Wide Web. </font><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Times New Roman">
<font size="4">Computer experts are urging people to take precautions.</font></span></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Not since the much-feared threat posed to the world's computers a year and a 
half ago by the so-called Y2K  glitch has a threatened computer  disruption 
received so much attention and advance warning. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　This time, the threat comes from what is being called the 'code red' worm, a 
computer program known as a virus, that surfaced earlier this month,  defacing 
websites with the words &quot;hacked by the Chinese&quot;. The White House website was 
among those targeted. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Computer security experts and the FBI are warning the computer virus is poised 
to make a  comeback as early as 0000 UTC Wednesday. But this time, it could be 
much more aggressive. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Ron Dick heads the FBI unit that goes after crimes in cyberspace. &quot;There is 
reason for concern that the mass traffic associated with the worm's 
 
propagation could degrade the overall functioning of the Internet and impact 
ordinary users,&quot; he said. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Experts describe the virus program as a sophisticated and aggressive worm, 
since it is able to  burrow into computer systems and the Internet. Any 
computer that runs on Microsoft operating systems could be  vulnerable. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Paul McNabb, vice president of Argus Systems, an Illinois-based company 
focusing on Internet security, expects corporate and government websites will be 
most at risk - not the individual Internet surfer. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;It has the potential of being very damaging temporarily to certain sites that 
have been targeted,&quot; he said. &quot;For most people, it will not affect them. The 
 
vast majority of people out there who are running their home machines will 
not see anything. Some of them might experience some downtime or slowness.&quot; </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Earlier this month, the worm infected more than 350,000 computer systems and 
slowed the Internet by 40 percent. But the virus can be easily prevented with a 
protection device that users can download from Microsoft's website. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　But not so easy to figure out is who is  responsible for  unleashing it 
into cyberspace. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;The fact that it seems to be attacking English language websites seems to 
point to the fact that it might be a non-English speaking  attacker and people 
have pointed to China as a potential one, but we do not know that,&quot; said Mr. 
McNabb. </font></p>     
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　The FBI says it considers the code red worm a threat to national security since 
so much business and public service everything from banking to power companies 
rely on the Internet.<br>
