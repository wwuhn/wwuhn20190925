Threatens Global Websites</b></font></p>

<p>　<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Internet users around the world are being warned to take ________
against what could be the most crippling computer ________
to  infect the World 
Wide Web. <br>
　Not since the much-feared threat ________
to the world's computers a year and a ________
ago by the so-called Y2K  glitch has a threatened computer ________
received so much attention and advance ________
. <br>
　This time, the threat comes from what is being called the 'code red' ________
, a 
computer program known as a virus, that ________
earlier this month,  defacing ________
with the words &quot;hacked by the Chinese&quot;. The White House website was 
among those ________
. <br>
　Computer security experts and the FBI are warning the ________
virus is poised 
to make a  comeback as ________
as 0000 UTC Wednesday. But this time, it could be 
much more ________
. <br>
　Ron Dick heads the FBI unit that goes after ________
in cyberspace. &quot;There is 
reason for ________
that the mass traffic ________
with the worm's 
 
propagation could degrade the overall ________
of the Internet and impact 
ordinary users,&quot; he said. <br>
　Experts ________
the virus program as a ________
and aggressive worm, 
since it is able to  burrow into computer ________
and the Internet. Any 
computer that runs on Microsoft operating ________
could be  vulnerable. <br>
　Paul McNabb, vice president of Argus Systems, an Illinois-based company ________
on Internet security, expects corporate and ________
websites will be 
most at risk - not the individual Internet ________
. <br>
　&quot;It has the potential of being very ________
temporarily to certain sites that 
have been ________
,&quot; he said. &quot;For most people, it will not ________
them. The 
 
vast majority of people out there who are ________
their home machines will 
not see anything. Some of them might ________
some downtime or slowness.&quot; <br>
　Earlier this month, the worm ________
more than 350,000 computer systems and ________
the Internet by 40 percent. But the virus can be easily ________
with a 
protection device that users can ________
from Microsoft's website. <br>
　But not so easy to ________
out is who is  responsible for ________
it 
into cyberspace. <br>
　&quot;The fact that it seems to be ________
English language websites seems to ________
to the fact that it might be a non-English speaking ________
and people 
have pointed to China as a ________
one, but we do not know that,&quot; said Mr. 
McNabb. <br>
　The FBI says it ________
the code red worm a threat to national ________
since 
so much business and public ________
everything from banking to power companies ________
on the Internet.</font></p>
