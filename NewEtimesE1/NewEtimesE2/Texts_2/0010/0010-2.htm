Last week, the heads of government of the Group of Eight held a three-day 
meeting in Genoa, Italy. The members are the leading industrial nations --the 
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada--and also Russia.
<br>
<br>
The leaders met to discuss world trade and economic development. They also 
discussed disease prevention, debt reduction, and other issues. Officials from 
several developing countries including Nigeria, Mali, Bangladesh and El Salvador 
were invited to take part in the conference for the first time. <br>
<br>
During the talks, about one-hundred-thousand protesters demonstrated outside the 
historic palace in Genoa where the meeting was held. They gathered there to 
express their anger about world trade. <br>
<br>
One person was killed during the protests. The Italian Interior Ministry says 
the demonstrator was shot in an act of self-defense by a member of Italy's 
national police force. <br>
<br>
Many protesters condemned the deadly use of force by the Italian police. The 
Group of Eight leaders expressed sorrow for the death and urged demonstrators to 
reject violence. <br>
<br>
The protesters represented trade unions, environmental groups, farmers, and the 
unemployed. Most shared a concern about the effects of international trade. Many 
of the protesters believe world trade harms the people of poor countries. They 
say major international companies are becoming wealthy while harming the poor 
and the environment. <br>
<br>
Opponents of world trade want wealthy nations to reduce debt in developing 
countries. They also called for better education in poor countries and more 
money to treat diseases in Africa. <br>
<br>
The Group of Eight leaders said world trade helps all people. They promised to 
work to bring the poorest countries into the world economy. And they promised to 
continue to deal with issues important to all areas of the world. <br>
<br>
The leaders also discussed the worldwide AIDS crisis and other deadly diseases. 
They agreed to provide more than one-thousand-million dollars to support efforts 
to prevent and treat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. These preventable diseases 
kill millions of people each year. Most of the victims live in poor countries.
<br>
<br>
One of the most disputed issues at the G-Eight meeting was the Kyoto treaty to 
halt the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. President Bush continues to reject 
the treaty. He says it would harm the American economy. Other leaders said they 
would work to put the treaty into effect. <br>
<br>
At the end of the conference, President Bush and Russian President Vladimir 
Putin announced they would hold new arms talks. They said they want to link 
talks about reducing nuclear weapons with American plans to build a missile 
defense system. <br>
