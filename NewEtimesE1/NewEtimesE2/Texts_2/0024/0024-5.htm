<p ALIGN="center"><b><font face="Georgia">Japanese Subaru Impreza WRX</font></b></p>             




<p>　<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Japanese automaker Subaru has  carved out a nice ________ of the U.S. 
market, establishing itself as the ________ of small, moderately-priced 
all-wheel-drive vehicles with a  ________ for reliability. Its newest 
offering for American ________ might be described using the  ________ term -  hot 
rod.<br>
　Everywhere but the United States, Subaru is known for its ________ in world 
 
rally competition. And the Subaru that carries the company ________ in rallies is 
the Impreza WRX. Now, Americans have a ________ to sample the  excitement others 
have enjoyed.<br>
　At first ________ , the Impreza WRX looks like many other modern compact 
 
sedans. On closer ________ , though, one sees a large air ________ on the hood, 
low-mounted fog  lamps and wide ________ and tires, clues to the kind of high 
 
________ that has made the editor of AutoWeek ________ , Dutch Mandel a fan 
of the car.<br>
　[Mandel said] &quot;The Subaru WRX has got to be ________ of the most fun per dollar 
that ________ in this country can get. You know, for $24,000 or  ________ , 
you get 227-horsepower in a two-liter ________ that is ... you just, you get a big 
________ every time you put your foot into it.&quot;<br>
　That is the ________ foot Mr. Mandel is talking about, the foot that 
________ the turbo-charged power plant and ________ plenty of performance. 
All-wheel drive and a  taut ________ , coupled with a five-speed manual ________ , give the feeling of a 
________ car in this four-passenger, 
four-door sedan.<br>
　Subaru's Mike Whelan ________ the intended customer for the WRX. &quot;Someone who 
________ driving for the pure joy of driving, ________ . For them, it is not the 
________ , it is the  journey. It is the fun of getting there, ________ through the gears, enjoying the 
________ of the car, the tightness of the ________ and the chassis, which really makes the driver feel at one with the 
________ ,&quot; 
Whelan said. We asked ________ Dutch Mandel if he has any ________ of the 
new Impreza. &quot;The only kind of criticism that we have, and I do not 
________ if it 
is a  criticism so much as it is a ________ of life, is that it is a hot rod &quot;econobox&quot; 
(small, inexpensive sedan). But, you ________ you are not getting a Mercedes. But 
then, you are not ________ Mercedes prices,&quot; Mandel said.<br>
　Mike Whelan says Subaru ________ buyers of the WRX to be young, but they got a 
bit of a surprise. &quot;There is quite a wide age ________ of buyers for the WRX, all 
the way from about age-25 up to 55 and older,&quot; [Whelan said] So the 
________ and 
the young-at-heart are finding they can ________ fast fun for a relatively low 
________ with Subaru's  impressive Impreza WRX. Not a bad ________ for success for 
any automaker. </font> </p>
