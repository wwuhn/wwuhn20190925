<p ALIGN="center"><b><font face="Georgia">Japanese Subaru Impreza WRX</font></b></p>             




<p ALIGN="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by John Birchard</font></p>             




<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Japanese automaker Subaru has  carved out a nice corner of the U.S. 
market, establishing itself as the producer of small, moderately-priced 
all-wheel-drive vehicles with a  reputation for reliability. Its newest 
offering for American buyers might be described using the  slang term -  hot 
rod.</font></p>             




<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Everywhere but the United States, Subaru is known for its success in world 
 
rally competition. And the Subaru that carries the company flag in rallies is 
the Impreza WRX. Now, Americans have a chance to sample the  excitement others 
have enjoyed.</font></p>             




<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　At first glance, the Impreza WRX looks like many other modern compact 
 
sedans. On closer inspection, though, one sees a large air scoop on the hood, 
low-mounted fog  lamps and wide wheels and tires, clues to the kind of high 
 
performance that has made the editor of AutoWeek magazine, Dutch Mandel a fan 
of the car.</font></p>             




<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　[Mandel said] &quot;The Subaru WRX has got to be some of the most fun per dollar 
that anyone in this country can get. You know, for $24,000 or  thereabouts, 
you get 227-horsepower in a two-liter engine that is ... you just, you get a big 
grin every time you put your foot into it.&quot;</font></p>             




<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　That is the accelerator foot Mr. Mandel is talking about, the foot that 
activates the turbo-charged power plant and produces plenty of performance. 
All-wheel drive and a  taut suspension, coupled with a five-speed manual transmission, give the feeling of a sports car in this four-passenger, 
four-door sedan.</font></p>             




<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Subaru's Mike Whelan describes the intended customer for the WRX. &quot;Someone who 
enjoys driving for the pure joy of driving, really. For them, it is not the 
destination, it is the  journey. It is the fun of getting there, shifting 
through the gears, enjoying the feel of the car, the tightness of the suspension 
and the chassis, which really makes the driver feel at one with the vehicle,&quot; 
Whelan said. We asked journalist Dutch Mandel if he has any criticisms of the 
new Impreza. &quot;The only kind of criticism that we have, and I do not know if it 
is a  criticism so much as it is a fact of life, is that it is a hot rod &quot;econobox&quot; 
(small, inexpensive sedan). But, you know you are not getting a Mercedes. But 
then, you are not paying Mercedes prices,&quot; Mandel said.</font></p>             




<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Mike Whelan says Subaru expected buyers of the WRX to be young, but they got a 
bit of a surprise. &quot;There is quite a wide age range of buyers for the WRX, all 
the way from about age-25 up to 55 and older,&quot; [Whelan said] So the young and 
the young-at-heart are finding they can obtain fast fun for a relatively low 
price with Subaru's  impressive Impreza WRX. Not a bad recipe for success for 
any automaker. <br>
