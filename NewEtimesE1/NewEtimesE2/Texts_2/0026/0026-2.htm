Computers</b></font></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Linda Cashdan</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Twenty million U.S. computers became  obsolete in 1998. Since the average 
life span of a computer today is less than three years and more than half of all 
U.S. homes have computers, dealing with  discarded computers is becoming a 
serious problem. The  toxic  substances contained in computers make disposing 
of them very difficult.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Burn them and you will create  carcinogens. Bury them and you will 
 
contaminate the ground water. The growing panic over what to do with used 
computers is forcing computer makers to become computer recyclers. </font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Gateway, for example, offers  rebates for customers who turn in old computers 
when buying new ones. Gateway spokesman Greg Lund says many an obsolete computer 
can be upgraded to appear - good as new.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;The ones that we are getting back in the recycling effort are very early 
machines that long ago lost their ability to be useful because they are so 
slow,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as they are pentium-based computers, they can be 
upgraded with more hard drive capacity, more  processor capacity and continue 
to be used.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Those that can not be  upgraded are sent off to be recycled. </font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Hewlett Packard recycles its own computers in partnership with a Canadian 
mining company. Environmental Director Renee St. Dennis says  hazardous 
substances like  cadmium and  mercury are extracted first.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;We pull those items out and we send those to our hazardous materials 
management firm that has all the specialized equipment to extract and reuse 
those potentially hazardous materials,&quot; she said. &quot;The mercury and cadmium can 
be reused. You just want to control how that is done.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　Ms. St. Dennis says the rest of the computer is  shredded down to the size of 
a coin and then put through a very  complicated separation process.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　&quot;We run the material across an 8 mm screen where all the tiny particles fall 
off,&quot; she said. &quot;From there the material travels across magnets that pull out 
the steel and stainless steel. So now in the end we have got nice clean streams 
of  commodities that can be sold and reused to make new products of all 
kinds.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　At the moment, the cost of retrieving that value is more than the metals are 
worth, so the company charges a fee for recycling. Hewlett Packard is 
considering setting up similar fee-based recycling programs in other countries.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">　As the problem of obsolete computers multiplies around the world, the 
technology developed to dispose of old computers may turn out to be as valuable 
as the technology developed to create new ones.</font></p>
