<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Researchers in the United States say dust clouds from dry African deserts may 
be a threat to the environment and human health. They say the dust may contain 
many small organisms that could be dangerous to some people. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Each year, huge dust storms form in the Sahara and the Sahel deserts of 
northern Africa. Winds carry the dust across the Atlantic Ocean. The movement of 
dust across the Atlantic Ocean has been increasing in recent years because of 
longer periods without rain in Africa. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">From February to April, the dust settles in South America. From June to 
October, the winds change and transport the dust to North America, Central 
America and the Caribbean. The dust clouds travel several thousand meters above 
sea level. It takes five to seven days for the dust to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
</font> 

<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Researchers have long known that the dust clouds could travel long distances. 
But they thought few microorganisms could survive the trip because of damaging 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Researchers now believe that the dust clouds 
block enough of the light to protect viruses, bacteria and fungi in the dust.
</font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Researchers say these microorganisms may be a health risk to some people. 
About half of the bacteria and fungi that survive the trip from Africa are known 
to cause disease in people, animals or plants. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">More than half of the dust that reaches the United States settles in the 
state of Florida. For many years, it has caused the skies there to turn red. Now 
researchers say there may be a link between the dust storms and increased health 
risks in Florida. They believe the dust causes higher rates of asthma, allergies 
and other breathing problems in people there. The dust also has been linked to a 
large increase in lung problems in at least one Caribbean nation. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Last year, American scientists published a study showing that the African 
dust is causing coral reef damage in the Caribbean. They identified organisms in 
the dust particles that cause coral diseases. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Scientists at the United States Geological Survey reported the latest 
findings. They used satellites from NASA, the United States space agency, to 
carry out their work. </font>
