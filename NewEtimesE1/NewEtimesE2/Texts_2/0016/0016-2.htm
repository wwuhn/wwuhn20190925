<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Welcome to AMERICAN MOSAIC -- VOA's 
radio magazine in Special English.<br>
<br>
This is Doug Johnson. Today is the Fourth of July, a holiday in the United 
States. On our program: We answer a question about how Americans celebrate this 
holiday ... And we tell about a related celebration in Europe ... But first, we 
explain why this is an important day for Americans.<br>
<br>
The Fourth of July is an important holiday in the United States. It is the day 
Americans celebrate the anniversary of their declaration of independence from 
Britain. Nicole Nichols has the story.<br>
<br>
In the summer of seventeen-seventy-six, the American colonists were deeply 
divided. Almost one in three was loyal to Britain. They could not imagine a war 
for independence. Yet most were increasingly angry about what they considered 
unfair treatment by the British government. Britain taxed them without giving 
them representation. It also canceled any of their laws that it did not like.<br>
<br>
By June, the colonies were in open revolt. Some fighting had already taken place 
between colonial forces and British troops. The idea of independence was 
spreading.<br>
<br>
Delegates from the thirteen colonies gathered in Philadelphia for a meeting of 
the Continental Congress. These delegates were divided, too. Some still hoped 
the colonies could reach an agreement with Britain. Others believed the colonies 
could gain their rights only by becoming independent.<br>
The Continental Congress agreed that a declaration of independence should be 
prepared. Thomas Jefferson led a committee chosen to write it. As they worked, 
the Congress continued to debate the question of independence.<br>
<br>
On July second, seventeen-seventy-six, the Congress took an official vote on the 
question. All the colonies except New York voted yes. The New York delegates 
said they were waiting for orders from home before voting. But they promised 
that their colony would also vote for independence.<br>
<br>
John Adams wrote to his wife later that day. He said that July second would 
become the official birthday of the new country. But he was wrong. It was July 
fourth that became American's official Independence Day. That was the day the 
Continental Congress voted to approve the document.<br>
<br>
The Declaration of Independence blamed the British government for all the wrongs 
done to the colonies. It declared that governments have the right to exist only 
to protect the rights of their people. And it said the people have the right to 
change their government if it denies them their rights.<br>
<br>
Now you know why July fourth is celebrated as Independence Day in the United 
States. But it might surprise you to learn that America's Independence Day is 
also celebrated in Denmark. Shep O'Neal explains.<br>
<br>
From the middle eighteen-eighties until nineteen-hundred, one out of every ten 
people in Denmark moved to the United States. They were poor farmers seeking a 
new economy and a better life. Most settled in America's Middle-West.<br>
<br>
In nineteen-twelve, these immigrants created an organization. The 
Danish-American Society bought land back home in Denmark, near Aalborg. That 
city is about two-hundred-fifty kilometers northwest of Copenhagen. The society 
gave the land to Denmark on the condition that America's Independence Day would 
be celebrated there every year.<br>
<br>
Denmark's ruler agreed. King Christian established a national park on the land. 
He said the park would represent the friendship between the two nations.<br>
<br>
That is why America's Independence Day has been celebrated ever since at Ribald 
National Park and in the city of Aalborg. The celebrations were cancelled, 
however, during the years Nazi Germany occupied Denmark during World War Two.<br>
<br>
Over the years, hundreds of thousands of visitors have joined with Danes in the 
celebration at Ribald Park. American and Danish flags fly side by side. People 
eat American and Danish food. They listen to speeches. Speakers have included 
presidents and other famous Americans. <br>
<br>
Celebrations in nearby Aalborg extend over several days. Events this year began 
on Wednesday and will continue until Sunday. The festivities include fireworks, 
parties, picnics and concerts. The United States Air Forces in Europe Band is 
taking part this year. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida is to speak, along with 
officials from the American Embassy in Copenhagen and the Danish ambassador to 
the United States.<br>
<br>
Our VOA listener question this week comes from China. Zhang Cai asks what 
Americans do on Independence Day.<br>
<br>
The traditional thing is to gather family and friends outside in the warm summer 
air, to play sports and eat hot dogs, hamburgers and chicken -- all cooked on 
charcoal fires.<br>
<br>
Towns and cities hold parades. People young and old take part. One modern 
patriotic song has found its way into many July Fourth celebrations. It is Lee 
Greenwood's 'God Bless The U.S.A.'<br>
<br>

From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee<br>
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea<br>
From Detroit down to Houston, and New York to L.A.<br>
Well, there's pride in every American heart, and it's time we stand and say<br>
<br>
And I'm proud to be an American<br>
Where at least I know I'm free<br>
And I won't forget the men who died<br>
Who gave that right to me<br>
And I'll gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today<br>
'Cause there ain't no doubt, I love this</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">As the sun goes down, the fireworks begin. In many cities and towns, people 
gather in open areas, such as a sports field or park. They watch bursts of 
bright colored stars and other shapes across the night sky. Many people consider 
fireworks to be the best part of any Fourth of July celebration. They say the 
exploding shells recall the Revolutionary War for independence that gave birth 
to the United States.<br>
<br>
We leave you now with a patriotic marching song heard at many Fourth of July 
fireworks shows. John Philip Sousa wrote it many years ago. It is 'The Stars and 
Stripes Forever.'<br>
