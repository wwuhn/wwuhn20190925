<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">An American archeologist has a new theory about an <span lang="en-us">
________ </span>statue found in 
Greece. Keith DeVries of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>the 
statue may have once belonged to King Midas. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">He <span lang="en-us">________ </span>the statue may have once been part of the 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>chair used by 
the king, called a throne. He says ancient <span lang="en-us">________ </span>and other evidence show the 
statue came from a <span lang="en-us">________ </span>that Midas is believed to have given as a 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>to the 
Greek god Apollo. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The small statue is <span lang="en-us">________ </span>as "The Lion Tamer." It shows a man and a 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>. It 
is about twenty-three centimeters tall. It is made of <span lang="en-us">
________ </span>, from the tusk of an 
elephant. It was <span lang="en-us">________ </span>in Nineteen-Thirty-Nine in Delphi, Greece. It had 
been <span lang="en-us">________ </span>with other objects near the ruins of the Corinthian Treasury 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">King Midas ruled an ancient country called Phrygia in <span lang="en-us">
________ </span>is now central 
Turkey. He lived about two-thousand-seven-hundred <span lang="en-us">________
</span>ago. King Midas was said 
to be extremely rich. <span lang="en-us">________ </span>said he could change anything he touched into 
gold. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The ancient <span lang="en-us">________ </span>historian Herodotus claimed to have seen King Midas's 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>in the Corinthian treasury at Delphi three-hundred years after the 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>died. The throne itself has not been found. The 
<span lang="en-us">________ </span>has cuttings in its back. 
This suggests it was once <span lang="en-us">________ </span>to something, possibly a chair.
</font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">"The Lion Tamer" statue is in a <span lang="en-us">________ </span>in Delphi, Greece. For years, experts 
have debated the statue's <span lang="en-us">________ </span>. Many experts thought it came from Greece. 
However, others <span lang="en-us">________ </span>it came from somewhere else.
</font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mister DeVries says the <span lang="en-us">________ </span>of similar ivory statues in Turkey adds 
support to his <span lang="en-us">________ </span>that the statue is Phrygian. Those objects were 
recovered from <span lang="en-us">________ </span>areas at the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordion 
and <span lang="en-us">________ </span>Elmali. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Scientists used a process known as radiocarbon dating to <span lang="en-us">
________ </span>that the 
statues date to the time of King Midas. <span lang="en-us">________ </span>dating shows the level of a

object was made. </font>
