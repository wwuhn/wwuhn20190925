<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">An American archeologist has a new theory about an ancient statue found in 
Greece. Keith DeVries of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says the 
statue may have once belonged to King Midas. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">He believes the statue may have once been part of the special chair used by 
the king, called a throne. He says ancient records and other evidence show the 
statue came from a throne that Midas is believed to have given as a gift to the 
Greek god Apollo. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The small statue is known as "The Lion Tamer." It shows a man and a lion. It 
is about twenty-three centimeters tall. It is made of ivory, from the tusk of an 
elephant. It was discovered in Nineteen-Thirty-Nine in Delphi, Greece. It had 
been buried with other objects near the ruins of the Corinthian Treasury 
building. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">King Midas ruled an ancient country called Phrygia in what is now central 
Turkey. He lived about two-thousand-seven-hundred years ago. King Midas was said 
to be extremely rich. Stories said he could change anything he touched into 
gold. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The ancient Greek historian Herodotus claimed to have seen King Midas's 
throne in the Corinthian treasury at Delphi three-hundred years after the king 
died. The throne itself has not been found. The statue has cuttings in its back. 
This suggests it was once attached to something, possibly a chair. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">"The Lion Tamer" statue is in a museum in Delphi, Greece. For years, experts 
have debated the statue's history. Many experts thought it came from Greece. 
However, others thought it came from somewhere else. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mister DeVries says the discovery of similar ivory statues in Turkey adds 
support to his argument that the statue is Phrygian. Those objects were 
recovered from burial areas at the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordion and at 
Elmali. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Scientists used a process known as radiocarbon dating to confirm that the 
statues date to the time of King Midas. Radiocarbon dating shows the level of a 
radioactive form of carbon in a substance. This can tell scientists when an 
object was made. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mister DeVries works for the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the 
University of Pennsylvania. He reported his research at a meeting of the 
Archaeological Institute of America in Philadelphia. </font>
