</font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Wildfires have been burning in forests in parts of the western United States 
this summer. American scientists are studying the effect of the wildfires on the 
environment. Some scientists have flown over the fires to measure the levels of 
the chemical element mercury in the smoke. The National Center for Atmospheric 
Research and the University of Washington are organizing the flights. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Scientists want to understand what causes mercury to form in Earth's 
atmosphere. They also want to learn how much of the chemical falls on the land 
and water and enters the food supply. High levels of mercury are poisonous to 
people and animals. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During a wildfire, mercury stored in trees and on the ground is released and 
carried into the atmosphere. Mercury travels as a gas in the atmosphere for 
about a year before landing in water or on the ground. About six-thousand metric 
tons of mercury are in the atmosphere at any one time. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">About half the mercury in the atmosphere comes from natural sources, such as 
oceans, soil and volcanoes. The other half comes from human activities. The 
Environmental Protection Agency estimates that American coal-burning factories 
release about thirty-seven metric tons of the chemical each year. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mercury changes in the atmosphere through chemical processes. It returns to 
Earth's surface in wet or dry particles. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hans Friedli is a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research 
in Boulder, Colorado. He says trees store mercury in their leaves or needles. It 
stays there until the trees burn. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The scientists carried out tests to find out how much mercury is released 
during a forest fire. For the experiment, researchers gathered trees from across 
the United States. They burned the trees at the Forest Service Fire Science 
Laboratory in Missoula, Montana. Scientific equipment immediately reported the 
presence of mercury when the trees were burned. All of the trees released nearly 
all the mercury they had stored. </font> 
<P><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The mercury studies developed from the scientists' efforts to understand 
wildfires and how they spread. They want to provide information to help 
firefighters battle such fires in the future. </font>
