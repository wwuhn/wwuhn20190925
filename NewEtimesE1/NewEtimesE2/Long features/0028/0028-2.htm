November Eleventh is Veterans Day in the United States. It honors the men and 
women of the American military forces. I'm Shirley Griffith. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And I'm Sarah Long. The Veterans Day holiday is our report today on the VOA 
Special English program, This is America. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((THEME))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Nineteen-million men and women living in the United States have fought in the 
nation's wars. Some of these people now have reached old age. Each day, 
one-thousand-five-hundred war veterans die. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States Congress did not want the nation to lose its chance to hear 
the veterans' stories. So, last year, lawmakers created the Veterans History 
Project. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Library of Congress Folklife Center is gathering material for this 
project. The Center is asking war veterans for recorded histories, letters, 
written memories, maps, photographs and home movies. The Veterans History 
Project includes veterans of World Wars One and Two. It also includes people who 
served in the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. All men and 
women who took part are invited to share their memories. This includes civilian 
helpers. All Americans are invited to talk to veterans who are family members 
and record their memories. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Now we will tell about some of these conflicts and the Americans who fought 
in them. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT ONE: BATTLE SFX))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">World War One. At the time, it was called the "war to end all wars." But, as 
everyone knows, other wars would be fought later. About two -million Americans 
served in Europe during World War One. More than one-hundred-sixteen-thousand of 
them were killed. Another two-hundred-thirty-five thousand were wounded. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States entered World War One in Nineteen-Seventeen. Its armed 
forces were very small. To prepare for war, the government ordered every man 
between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one to report for military duty.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT TWO: SFX OF TROOPS MARCHING))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The men came from cities and farms. Some were rich. Some were poor. There 
were doctors, lawyers, businessmen, professional athletes and college students. 
Many were married. More than nine-and-one-half million men reported for duty in 
June, Nineteen-Seventeen. About six-hundred-thousand were chosen to serve. They 
were sent to military camps for training before going to France. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The following year, the government expanded the call to serve in the 
military. It called on all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. More 
than thirteen-million reported for duty. The Army did not have enough bases to 
train all the new soldiers. So, it used many colleges and universities as 
military training centers. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Navy and Marine Corps had about eighty-two-thousand men when the United 
States entered World War One. A year later, there were almost three times that 
many sailors and Marines. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Many women joined the armed forces, too. Most women got office jobs at 
military bases in the United States. Some, however, went to France as nurses in 
battlefield hospitals. Their work made it possible for more men to fight. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT THREE: "OVER THERE"))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Finally, World War One ended. Germany surrendered at eleven o'clock in the 
morning on November Eleventh, Nineteen-Eighteen. It was the eleventh hour of the 
eleventh day of the eleventh month. On that day, thousands of Americans were 
completing their military training in the United States. Others were either in 
France or on boats sailing to France. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">They had arrived there in troop ships over a period of about eighteen months. 
It would take almost that long to bring them home. While they waited to return, 
many had a chance to see the sights of France -- especially Paris. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To the young men who grew up in big cities such as New York or Chicago, Paris 
was just another big city. But to the young men who grew up on farms or in small 
towns, Paris was unlike anything they had ever seen. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When the war ended, American soldiers wanted to return to the life they knew 
before going to France. Almost overnight, the number of troops in the American 
armed services dropped to what it had been before the war. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Nineteen, President Woodrow Wilson signed a declaration naming 
November Eleventh as Armistice Day in the United States. It would be a day to 
honor the men and women who had served in the American armed forces during World 
War One. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Twenty-Six, Congress made Armistice Day a national holiday. The 
federal government would close that day. Most state and local governments, and 
all public schools would close, too. Parades in almost every city honored the 
men and women who had helped bring peace to Europe. But even as they celebrated, 
new problems were on the way. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States soon began to suffer severe economic problems. The stock 
market crashed in Nineteen-Twenty-Nine. Thousands of businesses closed. Many 
people lost their homes and all the money they had saved. In the early 
Nineteen-Thirties, huge dust storms destroyed farmland in the middle western 
states. Families were forced to move to other states to find work. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Then political troubles began to appear in other parts of the world, 
especially in Europe and Asia. Soon, everyone knew that World War One had not 
been the war to end all wars. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT FOUR: SFX OF BATTLE ))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">More than four-million Americans served in the armed forces during the First 
World War. Four times that many would serve in the military during the next war.
</font> 

<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Most Americans who served in World War Two were young -- eighteen or nineteen 
years old. They were the sons and daughters of World War One veterans. They too 
hoped their war would be a final one. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A few Americans were called back to duty because of their experience in World 
War One. Others joined because they had no jobs. The military gave them food, 
clothes and a place to sleep. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States entered World War Two in Nineteen-Forty-One. Germany 
surrendered in May, Nineteen-Forty-Five, ending the war in Europe. Japan 
surrendered in August of that year, ending the war in the Pacific area. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Armistice Day in Nineteen-Forty-Five was a very special day in the United 
States. Most of the men and women who had fought in the war had returned home. 
So, instead of just honoring veterans of World War One that year, Americans also 
honored veterans of World War Two. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT FIVE: "ANCHORS AWEIGH"))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Fifty-Four, Congress decided to change the name of Armistice Day 
to Veterans Day. By then almost six-million more Americans had served in another 
military campaign -- the Korean War. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The number of veterans has continued to grow. Almost nine-million Americans 
served in the military during the Vietnam War. And thousands of others took part 
in military campaigns in the Caribbean nation of Grenada and in Panama. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hundreds of thousands of men and women served during the Persian Gulf War. 
Thousands also served as members of the United Nations peacekeeping force in 
Somalia. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Other American troops served to return the elected president to power in 
Haiti. And they helped keep peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbian province 
of Kosovo. Now they have been carrying out air strikes and ground operations in 
Afghanistan in the American-declared war against terrorism. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The term "veteran" is not restricted to those who served only during wartime. 
It includes anyone who has served in the military at any time. On November 
Eleventh, America's military veterans will be honored with ceremonies and 
parades across the nation. The president and other public officials will speak.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Americans will observe the anniversary of Veterans Day. They will honor the 
men and women of the armed forces who have served their country in war and in 
peace. </font>
