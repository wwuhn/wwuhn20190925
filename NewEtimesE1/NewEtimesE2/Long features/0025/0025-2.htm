</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And this is Bob Doughty with the VOA Special English program EXPLORATIONS. 
Today we tell about a special place on the Internet communications system that 
helps young children learn about the exploration of space. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And we tell about copying nature to help design devices that may help explore 
the planet Mars. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((THEME))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE ONE:</font><P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Researchers are studying a small Australian shellfish to help them build 
devices that could explore the surface of the planet Mars. Australian scientists 
at the University of Melbourne are studying a small shellfish called a yabby. 
The yabby is a small salt-water creature that looks like a crab. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">David Macmillan is a professor of zoology at the University of Melbourne. He 
says the yabby can do many different tasks although it has a very limited amount 
of intelligence. Researchers are studying the Yabby to see if they can make a 
device similar to it that can also perform difficult tasks. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mister Macmillan says this kind of research is called biomimetics. 
Biomimetics is the science of using successful designs found in nature and 
reproducing them as machines. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mister Macmillan says biomimetics is a quickly expanding part of scientific 
research. The kind of machines he is planning to build are called robots. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE TWO:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mister Macmillan says many small creatures like the yabby are able to make 
many of the same decisions that humans make. Yet they are not as intelligent as 
humans. For example, they search for and find food. They can choose a mate so 
they can produce young. They can also look for and find an area to make a home 
or nest. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mister Macmillan says humans make these same decisions using millions and 
millions of brain cells. Yet extremely small creatures like the Australian yabby 
shellfish make the same decisions using just thousands of brain cells. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE ONE:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mister Macmillan says the computer industry is now able to make powerful 
computers that are very small. These small computers can be placed in small 
machines that could do useful work. A powerful computer can act like a brain. So 
robots can be created to make decisions, similar to the simple decisions made by 
a yabby. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Mister Macmillan says a good example would be a robot that could be designed 
to look for water. Another could be designed to search for minerals or 
chemicals. These robots could also be designed so they could move across 
difficult areas of land and climb small hills. Their small computers could also 
be able to link together to perform work or to help each other complete a task. 
The little robots would be able to perform tasks that would be too dangerous for 
people. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE TWO:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Researchers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration say they 
want to expand their use of this kind of small robot. The NASA researchers say 
some robots can already do this kind of work. But these robots are much too 
large and weigh too much to be taken into space. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Researchers say they hope to see many of the small robots that have the 
intelligence that Yabbies have exploring Mars in the near future. They could 
provide information that will increase the chances of human exploration of the 
Red-Planet. </font>

<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE ONE:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In Nineteen Ninety-Eight, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
launched a very special and exciting space vehicle. Yet, it did not travel into 
space. This vehicle traveled in the computer Internet communications system. It 
is a Web site on the Internet called Space Place. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Space Place Web site is a joint effort by NASA, the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the California Institute of Technology and 
the International Technology Education Association. It was designed as a tool 
for teachers to help young children learn about space technology. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE TWO:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Space Place is meant for school children between the ages of eight and 
thirteen. However, it can really be enjoyed by anyone who wants to learn about 
many different space sciences. Among the subjects are space technology, Earth 
sciences and space sciences. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Space Place includes about forty activities that help children learn about 
these subjects. It includes games that help teach about space. Areas within the 
web site teach facts about the many different sciences used in space 
exploration. Other areas offer plans to help teachers present many of these 
subjects to their students. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE ONE:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Recently, the federal government counted the number of people living in the 
United States. This count takes place every ten years. It is called a census. 
Information collected in the latest census showed that Spanish is the first 
language for more than twenty-seven-million people in the United States. Almost 
thirteen-million speakers of Spanish do not speak English very well. This number 
includes many children. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">NASA officials decided that these Americans could use a Spanish language 
version of Space Place. It was launched last month. It is almost an exact copy 
of the English language Space Place. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE TWO:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The information and activities at the Space Place web site are developed by 
workers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Much of their work has been published 
in past copies of "The Technology Teacher," the magazine of the International 
Technology Education Association. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Teachers say that most of the information on Space Place is for young 
children. Yet much of it can be useful to older children in high school. </font>

</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE ONE:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">When you open the Space Place Web site, you will see a large screen with 
several drawings. Each drawing opens a link to another part of Space Place. 
Doctor Marc's Amazing Facts is only one of the many areas in this web site that 
you can visit. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">If you open Doctor Marc's Amazing Facts, you will find it links to twelve 
different questions. One of the links is called, "How Good is the Amazing Hubble 
Space Telescope?" </font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The answer is: "If you could see as well as the camera on the Hubble Space 
Telescope, you would be able to read the small print on a newspaper from one and 
a half kilometers away." The answer may be simple, but it clearly describes how 
powerful the Hubble Space Telescope really is. This area of Space Place also has 
a computer link to some of the beautiful color pictures produced by the space 
telescope. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Doctor Marc's Amazing Facts also answers the question about how satellites 
remain in the same position in the sky. The answer used the example of the GOES 
weather satellites. The job of a GOES is to study the weather over North 
America. The satellite orbits over the center of Earth at the equator and make 
one orbit a day. Since the Earth turns once a day, the weather satellite is 
moving at the same rate as the Earth and appears to stay in the same place in 
the sky all the time. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE TWO:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Another area in Space Place is called Space Science In Action. There, you can 
learn about many different sciences. One is called, "The Infrared Photo Album." 
This area shows many photographs including those of birds, a young boy, an 
alligator and a camel. You can look at these photographs as you normally would. 
You can also change the image to an infrared photograph. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Light is a form of energy. The human eye can see only some of this energy. 
Infrared photography permits us to see light energy the human eye can not see. 
Infrared photography is extremely valuable in space because it permits 
researchers to see space objects the human eye can not see. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">VOICE ONE:
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">You can visit NASA's Space Place if you have a computer and are able to link 
with the World Wide Web. Space Place provides valuable information in simple 
English that is easy to understand. And it provides the same information in 
Spanish. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">You can find Space Place by having your computer look for the words "Space 
Place." Enter it as one word: s-p-a-c-e-p-l-a-c-e. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Or you can enter the address. It is: w-w-w dot s-p-a-c-e-p-l-a-c-e dot 
n-a-s-a dot g-o-v. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">You can find the link to the Spanish language version of Space Place near the 
top of the opening page. Have Fun! </font>
