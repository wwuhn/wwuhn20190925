<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The  Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. is famous around the world.  
Each summer, the Smithsonian  organizes a celebration of  cultural  traditions.  It 
is called the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.  I'm Sarah Long. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And I'm Shirley Griffith.  We tell about the recent Smithsonian Folklife Festival on 
our report today on the VOA Special English program, THIS IS AMERICA. </font>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((THEME)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Visitors to Washington usually spend some time on the open grassy area called the 
National Mall.  The United States Capitol building is at the east end of the Mall.  The 
monument honoring America's sixteenth president, Abraham Lincoln, is at the west end.  
Museums and Smithsonian Institution buildings are on the north and south sides of the 
Mall. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Usually, the Mall is a place where people walk, sit or play.  But for ten days each 
summer, part of the area is crowded with unusual sights, sounds and smells.  That is 
when the Smithsonian holds its Folklife Festival.  Today, we bring you some of these 
sights and sounds. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT 1: CHINESE OPERA MUSIC)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
 <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That is the sound of Chinese  classical music  performed at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival this year. It was just one of many kinds of music that Festival visitors 
enjoyed. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">People have been visiting The Smithsonian Folklife Festival each summer for the 
past thirty-five years.  The word folklife describes the cultural traditions of a people.  
It includes their music and art. Their stories and celebrations.  The things they make for 
their homes and to sell. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
 <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">These cultural traditions are passed from old people to the young.  Few traditions 
are taught in schools.  Young people learn them from living within a cultural group. 
The Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage organized the 
festival.  It ended on July eighth.  Each festival is about different cultures and people.  
This year, the festival presented the cultures of New York City and the islands of 
 
Bermuda. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Bermuda includes more than three-hundred islands in the middle of the Atlantic 
Ocean.  About sixty-three-thousand people live on twenty of the islands.  One of these 
islands is also called Bermuda.  About four-hundred-thousand people visit that island 
each year.    Presentations at the Folklife Festival showed some of what those visitors 
see. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Three-hundred artists and crafts workers showed the different kinds of work 
performed by people in Bermuda.  These included a  beekeeper and his bees and 
boat builders with their boats.  One grassy area of the Mall was covered with small 
Bermudan boats and flowers common in the islands.  Bermudan athletes played 
 
cricket while  announcers explained the sport and told stories about it.  Visitors 
saw a small Bermudan house.  They learned about weddings and preparing food.  A 
large tent sold traditional food from Bermuda. 
On the musical stage, Bermudan musicians performed native music.  These 
included Bermudan  jazz,  religious songs,  calypso and reggae.  Here 
the calypso group called the Bermudan Strollers performs the song  "Don't Worry, 
Be Happy." </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">New York City was the other culture  represented at the Folklife Festival.  
Festival officials decided to show the city as its own people see it.   So the festival 
included people who  demonstrated how stocks and bonds are bought and 
sold on Wall Street in the financial area of New York.  The festival also included 
explanations and  demonstrations of the different kinds of  transportation used in 
New York. Visitors saw an underground rail car or subway. They also saw a taxicab and 
a city bus.  New York City bus driver Tony Palombella told stories about his eighteen 
years driving a bus in New York.  And he cooked some Italian food at the festival, too.  
He learned to cook Italian food from his mother. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Another kind of food that is culturally linked to New York City is the  bagel. A 
bagel is a thick, round piece of bread with a hole in the middle.  Old stories say the 
bagel was first developed in Poland and brought to New York by Polish Jews.  Bagels 
have become  extremely  popular in the United States. You can buy them just 
about anywhere in the country today.  But many Americans say the best bagels are 
made and sold in New York City. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Steve Ross probably would agree.   He has owned a bagel shop in New York for 
more than sixty years.  At the Folklife Festival, he demonstrated how to make bagels 
and another kind of bread, a  bialy.  A bialy is also a round piece of bread, but it is 
thinner than a bagel and has no hole in the middle.  Instead, it has  onions in the 
middle. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Folklife Festival representation of New York City was really a celebration of 
many different cultures.  Each culture represented a group of people who came to the 
United States from a different country and settled in New York City.  These people 
include  Greeks, Indians, Chinese,  Albanians,  Caribbeans, Africans, 
Europeans, Lebanese,  Ukrainians and many others. 
The Festival presented music of these different groups.  Many New Yorkers still 
perform and enjoy this music as a way of keeping their culture alive.  Here is an 
example -  Romanian-Gypsy music. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Artists were also represented in the New York celebration at the Folklife 
Festival. One group is called Tats Cru. It is a six-person graffiti organization.  Graffiti is 
artwork painted on the subway cars in New York. Teenagers would paint the cars 
and the station walls with bright colors, words and pictures.  Such graffiti has been 
 
illegal in New York for many years.  
The three founding members of Tats Cru started painting graffiti in New York twenty 
years ago.  Tats Cru is now a legal business.  It paints pictures on buildings.  The 
artists have worked in the United States, Canada and Europe.  At the Folklife Festival, 
they painted a large picture on a special wall. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The musical shows presented on  Broadway in New York were also represented 
at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.  People who make clothes for performers in 
Broadway shows demonstrated their skills.  So did a  theatrical  wig maker, a 
person who makes false hair for people acting in plays. Actors and singers showed how 
a Broadway musical is prepared.  We leave you now with some music from that show, 
"Guys and Dolls". </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
