<b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">MEMORIAL DAY AND WAR MEMORIALS</font></b></h3>

<p align="center"><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Shelley Gollust</font></i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Monday is Memorial Day in the United States.  It is the national holiday when 
Americans honor the  military men and women who died in battle.  Visitors to 
Washington, D-C can see four major  memorials to these men and women. I'm 
Shirley Griffith.</font></p>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That music is called "Taps."  It is played at military  funerals to honor soldiers 
who have died.  The sound of  Taps is being heard at cemeteries throughout the 
United States as America honors its war dead. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Memorial Day holiday started in Eighteen-Sixty-Eight.  The purpose was to 
honor soldiers killed during the Civil War between America's northern and southern 
states.  Back then, the holiday was called Decoration Day.  People used flowers and 
 
ribbons to decorate the burial places of those killed during the war.  Today, 
Memorial Day honors the men and women who died in all of America's wars. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The first yearly  observance of Memorial Day was at the National Cemetery in 
Arlington,  Virginia.  The cemetery is across the Potomac River from Washington, 
D.C.  It is the largest and most famous national burial place in the United States.  It 
includes about 200 hectares of rolling hills.  Up and down the hills are lines of simple, 
white stones marking the graves where the soldiers are buried.  About two- hundred- 
thousand soldiers are buried there.  They include military and political leaders,
cabinet officers, and Supreme Court judges. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Only two American presidents are buried at Arlington National Cemetery.  One is 
William Howard Taft.  He was president in the early Nineteen- Hundreds.  The other is 
John Kennedy.  He was president in the early Nineteen-Sixties.  He was murdered 
during his first term in office.  A fire burns all the time over President Kennedy's burial 
place.  More people have visited his  grave than any other in the United States.

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Memorial Day ceremonies also are being held at the Vietnam  Veterans 
Memorial in Washington.  The ceremonies honor Americans killed in fighting in Vietnam. 
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial was the idea of Jan Scruggs.  Mister Scruggs fought in 
Vietnam.  After the war, he was deeply troubled.  He and others felt that American 
soldiers killed in  Vietnam had been forgotten.  So, he organized efforts to build a 
monument to honor them.  He wanted to put on the monument the name of every 
American who died or was missing in the Vietnam War. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Eighty, a group of former soldiers announced a national competition.  
The veterans' group invited American artists to create a memorial to help unite the nation 
after the Vietnam War had divided it.  Eight famous designers and artists were the 
judges.  They judged more than 1,400 designs.  They chose the design of Maya Lin.  
Mizz Lin was twenty-one years old.  She was studying architecture at Yale University in 
New Haven, Connecticut.  She designed a memorial made of two black  stonewalls.  The memorial opened in Nineteen-Eighty-Two.
</font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">  

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The two black stonewalls are set into the earth.  They are about seventy-six 
meters long.  They form a wide letter "V".  As you walk down into the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial, the walls rise above you.  Cut into the walls are the names of the fifty- eight- 
thousand- two- hundred- twenty- six Americans who died or are still missing.  The 
names are listed in the order that the soldiers died.  Those who died together are 
remembered together.  Nearby is a  statue of three soldiers.  They seem to be 
looking at the wall of names. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Vietnam Veterans Memorial has become one of the most-visited places in 
Washington.  About one and one-half million people visit it every year.  People who go 
there experience powerful emotions.  Many say it has become almost a (14) holy place.  
Almost any time of day, you can see people standing at the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial wall.  They are looking at the name of a family member or friend who died in 
Vietnam.  Some reach out and touch the name.  Some put a piece of paper over it.  
They rub the paper with a pencil so the name on the wall appears on the paper.  In this 
way, they are able to take part of the memorial with them. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The success of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial influenced veterans of the 
Korean War to press for a memorial of their own.  Congress approved the idea.  In July, 
Nineteen-Ninety-Five, the Korean War Veterans Memorial opened.  It is near the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  It honors the men and women who served, and those who 
died, in the Korean War from Nineteen-Fifty to Nineteen-Fifty-Three. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Korean War Veterans Memorial has several parts.  The war has been called 
"the last foot soldier's war."  So, the memorial includes a series of nineteen statues of 
soldiers, walking.  Artist Frank Gaylord created the statues from steel.  Each is 
more than two meters high.  The soldiers seem to be moving up a hill toward a large 
American flag. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
 <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On one side of the memorial is a stone walkway.  It shows the names of the 
twenty-two countries that sent troops to serve in Korea under the United Nations 
command.  On the other side is a shiny stonewalls.  It shows images of more than two- 
thousand- four- hundred support troops.  These include nurses, cooks, and truck drivers.  
The faces were  reproduced from photographs taken during the war. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The last part of the memorial is the round Pool of  Remembrance.   The pool 
shows the number of American and United Nations forces who died, or who were 
wounded, captured, or missing in the war.  The number totals more than two- million.  
Cut into the wall above the pool is the simple yet powerful message:  "Freedom is not 
free." </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">

 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The newest war memorial in the Washington area has a long name. It is called the 
Women in Military Service for America Memorial.  It is very different from the other war 
memorials.  It recognizes the service of all the women who served in all of the nation's 
wars. One- million- eight- hundred- thousand American women were part of the 
country's military forces.  Former President Ronald Reagan signed  legislation in 
Nineteen-Eighty-Six to honor American women in the military. </font>   
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A retired air force general, Wilma Vaught, was chosen to lead the effort to build the 
memorial.  The memorial took eleven years to build.  It cost more than twenty-one 
million dollars. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The women's military memorial opened in October 1997.  It is near the entrance to 
Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.  Michael Manfredi and Marion Gail Weiss 
designed the women's memorial.  It is a place of glass, water and light.  The memorial 
has a large wall that is shaped in a half-circle.  In front of the memorial, two- hundred 
 
jets of water meet in a pool. The designers say this water fountain celebrates 
the combined strength of many individuals. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Inside the memorial, the stories of women in wartime are cut into glass  panels. 
The memorial also has information about military women on a computer. It includes 
names, pictures, service records and personal statements of about two- hundred- fifty- 
thousand military women. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">General Vaught says it was important for women in the military to be honored 
because their efforts have not been recognized.  She says the Women in Military 
Service for America Memorial will help tell a story that has never been told before.
