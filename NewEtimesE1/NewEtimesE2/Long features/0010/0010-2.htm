<p align="center"><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by RICHARD THORMAN</font></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I'm rich Kleinfeldt.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And I'm Shirley Griffith with the VOA special English program, people in America. 
Today we finish the story of Robert Frost and his poetry.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(Theme) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When Robert Frost left the United States in nineteen-twelve 
      he was an unknown writer. When he returned from Britain three years later 
      he was on his way to becoming one of America's most honored writers.&nbsp; 
      Publishers who had rejected his books now competed against each other to 
      publish them. Unlike many poets of his time Frost wrote in traditional 
      forms. He said that not using them was like playing a game that had no 
      rules. He joined the rules of the form with the naturalness of common 
      speech. Other poets before him had tried to do this, but none with Frost's 
      skill.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The common speech frost used had the words and way of speaking that could 
be easily seen as American.  For example, a poem called "the death of the hired man" 
begins:</font><blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
          <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mary sat musing on the  lamp-flame at the table <br>               
waiting for warren. When she heard his step,<br>
           she ran on  tip-toe down the darkened passage <br>
           to meet him in the doorway with the news<br>
            and put him on his guard. 'Silas is back.'</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Frost is telling a story about an old farm worker named Silas. The  discussion 
between warren and Mary continues:</font><blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">she pushed him outward with her through the door
        and shut it after her. 'Be kind,' she said.<br>
        She took the market things from warren's arms
        and set them on the  porch, then drew him down
        to sit beside her on the  wooden steps.</font></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Warren says:</font><blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">'when was I ever anything but kind to him?<br>
        But I'll not have the fellow back,' he said.<br>
        'I told him so last  haying, didn't I?'<br>
        If he left then, I said, that ended it.'</font></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">and Mary says:</font><blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">'he's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.<br>
        When I came up from Rowe's I found him here,<br>
        huddled against the barn-door fast asleep....</font></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Through the discussion between warren and Mary the reader discovers more 
and more about Silas.  In some ways he is a good worker, but he usually disappears 
when he is most needed.  He does not earn much money.  He has his own ideas about 
the way farm work should be done.  And he has his own ideas about himself. Instead of 
asking for help from his rich brother, Silas has come to warren and Mary.  She says:</font><blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">...he has come home to die: <br>
        you needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time.'<br>
        'Home,' he mocked gently.</font></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">She answers: </font> <blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">'yes, what else but home?<br>
        'Home is the place where, when you go there,<br>
        they have to take you in.'</font></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Without ever having Silas speak, frost has made the reader know this 
       tired old man, who has come to die in the only home he has. In the final 
       lines of the poem the story of Silas is completed. Mary says:</font><blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
          <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">'I made the bed up for him there tonight.<br>
        You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken.<br>
        His working days are done; I'm sure of it.<br>
        Go, look, see for yourself.'<br>
        warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,<br>
          slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited. <br>       'Warren?' She 
questioned.<br>
          'Dead,' was all he answered.<br>
          </font>
          </blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
    <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The poem tells of the understanding that Mary and warren have for a man who has 
worked for them for many years.  The poem also presents a sadness that Frost repeats 
many times.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Frost was like an earlier new England writer and thinker, Ralph Waldo Emerson.  
They never were good at joining others in programs or movements.  Frost was politically 
(16) conservative and avoided movement of the left or right.  He did this not because he 
did not support their beliefs, but because they were group projects. In the poem 
"mending wall" the speaker and his neighbor walk together along a wall, repairing the 
damage caused by winter weather:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>
        That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<br>
        And spills the upper  boulders in the sun;<br>
        And makes gaps even two can pass  abreast.<br>
        No one has seen them made or heard them made,<br>
        But at spring  mending time we find them there.<br>
        I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;<br>
        And on a day we meet and walk the line<br>
        And set the wall between us once again.<br>
        We keep the wall between us as we go.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The speaker questions his neighbor who says, "good  fences make good 
neighbors."  The speaker says:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">before I built a wall I'd ask to know <br>
       what I was walling in or walling out,<br>
        and to whom I was like to give offense.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Frost's later poetry shows little change or development from his earlier writing.  
It confirms what he had established in such early books as north of Boston.  For 
example, a poem called " birches," written in nineteen-sixteen begins:
       Narrator:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">when I see birches bend to left and right<br>
        across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>
        I like to think some boy's been  swinging them.<br>
        But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay<br>
        as ice storms do.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
      <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">and it ends:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,<br>
        and climb black branches up a snow-white trunk<br>
        toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<br>
        but dipped its top and set me down again.<br>
        That would be good both going and coming back.<br>
        One could do worse than is a swinger of birches.<br>
   　</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the nature poems there is often 
        a comparison between what the poet sees and what he feels. It is what 
        frost in one poem calls the difference between &quot;outer and inner 
        weather.&quot; Under the common speech of the person saying the poem is a 
        dark picture of the world. </font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In &quot;the road not taken&quot; he says:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">two roads  diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        and sorry I could not travel both<br>
        and be one traveler, long I stood<br>
        and looked down one as far as if could<br>
        to where it bent in the  undergrowth;<br>
        then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
        and having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        though as for that the passing there <br>
       had worn them really about the same, <br>
       and both that morning equally lay <br>
       in leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
       I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
      I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
       somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
        two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- <br>
       I took the one less traveled by,<br>
        and that has made all the difference.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Among Frost's nature poems, there are more about winter than about any other 
season.  Even the poems about spring, autumn, or summer remember winter.  They 
are not poems about happiness found in nature.  They are moments of resistance to 
time and its changes.  And even the poems that tell stories are mainly pictures of 
people who are alone.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Frost shared with Emerson the idea 
       that everybody was a separate individual, and that groups weakened 
       individuals. But where Emerson and those who followed him looked at god 
       and saw a creator, Frost saw what he says is &quot;no expression, nothing to 
       express.&quot; Frost sees the world as a &quot;desert place.&quot; In a poem called 
       &quot;desert places,&quot; he says:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast<br>
        in a field I looked into going past,<br>
        and the ground almost covered smooth in snow,<br>
        but a few weeds and  stubble showing last.<br>
        The woods around it have it--it is theirs.
        <br>
        All animals are smothered in their lairs.<br>
        I am too absent-spirited to count;<br>
        the loneliness includes me unawares.<br>
        And lonely as it is that loneliness <br>
       will be more lonely ere it will be less-- <br>
       a blanker whiteness of  benighted snow <br>
       with no expression, nothing to express.<br>
        They cannot scare me with their empty spaces<br>
        between stars--on stars where no human race is. <br>
       I have it in me so much nearer home<br>
        to scare myself with my own desert places.<br>
        </font>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Frost received almost every honor a writer could receive.  He won the Pulitzer 
Prize for literature four times. In nineteen-sixty, congress voted frost a gold medal for 
what he had given to the culture of the United States.</font><p style="text-align: justify">       
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the last years of his life, 
Frost was no longer producing great poetry, but he represented the value of poetry in 
human life.  He often taught, and he gave talks.  Usually he would be asked to read his 
best known poem, "stopping by woods on a snowy evening:"</font><p style="text-align: justify">
        <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Whose woods these are I think I know<br>
        his house is in the village though;<br>
        He will not see me stopping here<br>
        to watch his woods fill up with snow.<br>
        My little horse must think it queer<br>
        to stop without a farmhouse near <br>
       between the woods and frozen lake  <br>
        the darkest evening of the year. <br> 
        He gives his harness bells a shake <br>
       to ask if there is some mistake.<br>
        The only other sound's the sweep<br>
        of easy wind and  downy flake.<br>
        The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br>
        But I have promises to keep,<br>
        and miles to go before I sleep,<br>
        and miles to go before if sleep.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Robert Frost died in nineteen-sixty-three.  He had lived for almost one- hundred 
years, and had covered many miles before he slept, many miles before he slept.
