<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The United States National  Archives and  Records Administration stores and 
shows  historic documents. It tells the history of America in millions of papers and other 
records.  I'm Sarah Long.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And I'm Steve Ember. We tell about the National Archives in our report today on the 
VOA Special English program, THIS IS AMERICA. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Everything about the National Archives and Records Administration seems big. More 
than four- thousand- million pieces of paper in the National Archives record government 
activities. The Archives collection includes more than five- million maps and architectural drawings.  There are two- hundred- thousand sound and video recordings. The 
Archives keep many films,&nbsp; electronic records and almost fourteen- million pictures. 
The records tell about government policies and how they were carried out.  They tell 
how early Americans settled the West.  The records show how the United States changed 
from an agricultural society to an industrial nation. Archives records show the struggle by 
African Americans and other&nbsp; minorities to gain equality. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The National Archives and Records Administration were 
created in Nineteen-Thirty-Four as an independent federal agency. It operates thirty-three 
centers across America.  The Archives provide a central organization for research into 
the history of the United States and its citizens.  They also show visitors important historical 
documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   
Millions of people have seen these papers in the National Archives Building in Washington, 
D-C.  
The Archives also provide information for other government agencies.  These include 
the space agency and the tax agency.  The National Archives also operate the libraries 
of ten former American presidents.</font><p style="text-align: justify">  
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE))</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Currently, one of the most popular Archives collections is in College Park, Maryland.  It 
contains voice recordings from the administration of the thirty-seventh president, Richard 
Nixon.   Mister Nixon speaks with his advisors on these tapes. The recordings show he 
approved a plot to cover up an illegal raid on the Democratic Party headquarters. The 
raid took place in Nineteen-Seventy-Two at the Watergate Hotel in Washington.  Mister 
Nixon resigned the presidency the next year.  In doing so, he avoided being charged with wrongdoing by the House of Representatives. 
Last month, the Archives invited the public to reproduce these recordings.  Many 
students, teachers and historians now are copying these important moments in American life 
on their own tape recorders. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Archives also keep records about many people not as well known as presidents. 
For example, they contain  military service records for the Rough Riders. These soldiers 
fought in the Spanish-American War of Eighteen-Ninety-Eight.  They won battles at Kettle 
Hill and San Juan Hill in Cuba.  Their commander, Theodore Roosevelt, later became 
America's twenty-sixth president. 
People seeking information about their families use the Archives to study  genealogy. Survivors of Nazi oppression during World War Two often search the Archives.  
They use the records to try to find out what happened to property stolen from them.
</font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many people have written books using information they found in the Archives. Archives 
official Timothy Mulligan is one of them.  He is an expert in German military history of World 
War Two.  In the early Nineteen-Eighties, Mister Mulligan read the burial records of a 
German  submarine commander named Werner Henke.  Mister Mulligan became very 
interested.  He used his research to write a book called "Lone Wolf."  It was published in 
Nineteen-Ninety-Three. The book tells the story of Werner Henke and the war at sea 
between Germany and the United States.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE))</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Before the Archives existed, fire had destroyed millions of American documents.  Or 
they were destroyed because of age.  Today, highly trained employees called  conservators store most of the papers.  They use specially designed boxes.  These boxes 
are free of harmful chemicals.  They also resist fire.  Conservators 19) carefully measure 
the  temperature, moisture and light levels in areas where the documents are kept.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Concern about the condition of the documents has led officials to plan major 
changes in the National Archives building in Washington.  The most valued historic 
documents now are shown in an area called the Rotunda.  Every night, moving devices 
place the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in an 
underground 22) container.  The next day the documents are lifted back to the Rotunda.  
The Rotunda will close after July Fourth for repairs.  A new, secure home for the 
documents will be built to avoid continually moving them.  The research areas of the 
building will be made larger.  But they will remain open during the  23) process.  The 
improvements to the National Archives Building will cost more than one- hundred- million 
dollars. The work probably will be completed by Two-Thousand-Three.</font><p style="text-align: justify">  
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many Americans still can see the Constitution and other documents while the Rotunda 
is closed.  The Archives are lending them to museums and history centers in seven cities 
across the nation.  This traveling exhibit is called "American Originals."  It will begin in 
October.  The first showing will be held in the New York Public Library in New York City.   
The exhibit later will travel to cities in Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, Texas, California and 
Connecticut.   Each showing will last three months. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The traveling National Archives exhibit includes papers from the early days of America 
to more recent times.   For example, it contains a list of the things General George 
Washington bought during the  Revolutionary War.  The American colonies fought for 
independence from Britain beginning in Seventeen-Seventy-Five. General Washington gave 
the list to Congress so he could be repaid.  He later became the first president of the United 
States.   
A letter from the famous spy Benedict Arnold to George Washington also is part of the 
exhibit.   Benedict Arnold had served as a general in the Revolutionary Army.  But he sold 
information to the British.  He left his wife behind when he fled to escape capture.   
Benedict Arnold's letter appealed to General Washington not to punish her.</font><p style="text-align: justify">     

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A note written by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman during the Civil War is 
also in the exhibit.  General Sherman sent the message to President Abraham Lincoln in 
December of Eighteen-Sixty-Four. The general's troops had recently captured the southern 
city of Savannah, Georgia. His note presented the city to Mister Lincoln as a gift for the 
Christmas holiday. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The traveling Archives exhibit also will show an important announcement written by 
President Lincoln during the Civil War.  This  Emancipation Proclamation freed 
the slaves in southern states still at war with the Union.  President Lincoln made the 
proclamation public on January first, Eighteen-Sixty-Three. Sadly, the document is in 
threatened condition.  Time has harmed its paper and writing.  It will be shown for only four 
days in each city. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE))</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The National Archives traveling  exhibit also honors inventor Thomas Alva Edison.  
Mister Edison lived from Eighteen-Forty-Seven to Nineteen-Thirty-One.  He helped develop 
electric lighting and invented the record player.   He also improved the telegraph, the 
telephone and moving pictures. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The work of Mister Edison helped make the United States a strong industrial nation. 
The traveling Archives show includes the document that confirmed his legal rights to the 
electric light bulb.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A more recent document in the National Archives traveling exhibit shows the human 
side of American history.  It is a letter from Harry Truman to his wife.  He wrote the letter 
just after becoming America's thirty-third president.  He had been serving as vice president 
when President Franklin Roosevelt died suddenly in Nineteen-Forty-Five. Mister Truman's 
words demonstrate his feelings about following one of America's most loved leaders.  Harry 
Truman told his wife he could hear the spirits of the past walking in the White House.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
