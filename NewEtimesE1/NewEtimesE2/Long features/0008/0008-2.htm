     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And I'm Steve ember with the VOA special English program people in America.  
Today, we tell about Stephen Foster, America's first popular professional songwriter.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">(Music Bridge).</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">You may have heard the old traditional American songs "Oh! Susanna," 
       &quot;Camp 
       Town Races" and "My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. But do you know who wrote them?  Stephen 
foster.  He wrote those and more than two hundred other songs during the eighteen-
forties and eighteen-fifties.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">His best songs have become part of America's cultural history. They have 
become Americans folk songs.  Many people in America learned to sing these 
songs when they were children.  Most Americans can sing these songs today.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Stephen Collins foster was born on July fourth, eighteen-twenty-six in what is now 
part of the city of  Pittsburgh, in the northeastern state of Pennsylvania.  He was 
the ninth child of William and Eliza Foster.  He did not have much musical training.  
But he had a great natural ability for music.  He taught himself to play several musical 
 
instruments. He could play any music just by listening to it.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Stephen foster began writing songs when he was fourteen.  In eighteen- forty- 
seven, he wrote his first successful song, "oh! Susanna."</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Ken Emerson wrote a book about Stephen Foster.  It is called doo-dah! Stephen 
foster and the rise of "American popular culture. Mister Emerson says "oh! Susanna" 
was the first  internationally popular song written by an American that everyone can 
still  recognize and sing today.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music cut #1: "oh! Susanna"))</font><p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Stephen Foster married Jane McDowell in eighteen-fifty.   He wrote many new 
songs.  Some of them were about love.  One of the best known is "Jeanie with the light 
 
brown hair."  He wrote it for his wife when they were  separated.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music cut #2: "Jeanie with the light brown hair."))</font><p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Stephen Foster wrote almost thirty songs for  minstrel shows. Minstrel 
shows became popular in the United States in the eighteen-forties.  White 
entertainers blackened their faces and performed as if they were black entertainers.  
Minstrel shows included music, dance and comedy.  The shows were performed in 
almost every major American city, especially in the northeast. One of Foster's songs 
written for minstrel shows is "camp town races."  Today, it is a popular song for children.</font><p style="text-align: justify">       
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music cut #3: &quot;camp town races&quot;)) </font><p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Minstrel songs described the culture of black American slaves in the southern 
states.  Yet Foster did not really know anything about this subject.  He lived in 
Pittsburgh for most of his life. He visited the south only once.       However, some 
experts say Foster's minstrel songs showed he did understand how black people in the 
south lived before the civil war.  The people in Foster's songs love their families and 
work hard.  Now, however, some of his songs are judged insulting to African-Americans.  
So, music  publishers have changed some of the words.  And a few of his songs 
are no longer sung. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In eighteen-fifty, Foster made an  agreement with the leader of a 
successful minstrel group, e. P. Christy.  The agreement meant that Christy's minstrels 
had the right to perform every new song foster wrote.  Foster also  permitted 
Christy to name himself as the writer of the song "old folks at home."  This became one 
of most successful songs written by Stephen Foster.  It became the official song of the 
state of Florida in nineteen- thirty- five. It also is known as "way down upon the Swanee 
River."</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music cut #4:  "old folks at home"))</font><p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Stephen foster wrote other songs about home and  memories of times past.  
In his book, Ken Emerson says foster wrote songs about home in part because he 
almost never lived in one home for long. His father lost all his money when Stephan was 
a boy.  So Stephen was forced to live with many different family members.  Although 
Foster lived in the north, some of his songs suggest a desire to be back home in the 
American south.</font><p style="text-align: justify">     
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">"My old Kentucky home" is an example.  Mister Emerson says 
foster wrote the song in honor of Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery book, Uncle Tom's 
cabin.  "My old Kentucky home" expresses great sympathy for enslaved African 
Americans.  The black anti-slavery activist Frederick Douglass praised the song.  It 
later became the official song of the state of Kentucky.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music cut #5: "my old Kentucky home"))</font><p style="text-align: justify">
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Stephen Foster was America's first full-time professional songwriter. He was a good 
songwriter. But he was a poor businessman. He sold many of his most famous songs for 
very little money.  He was not able to support his wife and daughter.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In eighteen-sixty, he moved to New York City.  His songs were not as popular 
as they had been.  His marriage had ended.  He had no money.  For most of his life, 
he drank large amounts of alcohol. He died on January thirteenth, eighteen- sixty- four.  
He was only thirty-seven years old.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Stephen Foster was honored in several ways after his death.  He was the first 
musician to be  nominated to the hall of fame for great Americans.  And he was 
the first American composer whose complete works were published together.  Each 
year, on the anniversary of his death, people in Pittsburgh gather to remember 
Stephen Foster.  They go to the church he attended as a child. They attend a show that 
 
honors him.  Then they visit his burial place.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The end of Stephen Foster's life was sad.  But his songs have brought 
happiness to many people.  One of his last songs was one of the most beautiful.  It is 
called "beautiful dreamer."</font><p style="text-align: justify">
