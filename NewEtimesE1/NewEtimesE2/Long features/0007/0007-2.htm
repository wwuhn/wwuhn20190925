Every weekend, many Americans drive around looking for things to buy.  They are 
taking part in an unusual kind of outdoor  treasure hunt.  I'm Shirley Griffith.</font><p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((THEME)) <br>
 "Everybody loves a  bargain" is a well-known saying.  A bargain is a good deal.  It 
is something you get for less than its  value.  One person's useless, ugly, or broken 
object can be another person's bargain.  That is why so many Americans do not throw 
things away.  They put them outside their house.  They put on a "For Sale" sign.  And, 
as simple as that, they have a yard sale. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In some parts of the country, such a sale might be called a  garage sale or a moving 
sale.  Whatever the name, the activity is the same.  People sell things they no longer 
want. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Over the years, many people's houses fill up with objects: Books no one wants to read 
any more.  Baby clothes for the child  who is now a university student. 
These objects are no longer useful to the first owner.  Yet it seems  wasteful to 
throw them away.  Often, people must make a decision about things when they move to 
a different house. "Let's have a yard sale," they say. "Then we will not have to move the 
things we do not use anymore.  And we can make a little money at the same time."
</font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The sellers put a paid  announcement in a local newspaper.  It tells when and 
where the yard sale will take place.  It lists some of the things to be sold.  These sales 
are very popular during weekends in spring, summer, and autumn.  On one weekend, 
for example, you can find announcements for almost two-hundred yard sales around 
Washington, D-C. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Early in the morning, all the things to be sold are carried out of the house.  Then they 
sit all day in the sunlight -- like tired guests at a party -- waiting for someone to take them 
home. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Just about anything can be sold at a yard sale.  Sometimes, there are more clothes 
than anything else.  Cooking  equipment is also popular.  So are old toys, tools, 
books, tables, and chairs. Then there are objects called "white elephants."  A white 
elephant is something you think is extremely ugly or useless. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It may be an electric light shaped like a fish.  You feel a sharp  )pain whenever you 
look at it.  To someone else, however, it might be a thing of beauty and joy. 
Usually, the seller puts a price on each object at a yard sale.  However, that price can 
almost always be  negotiated.  The price of a table, for example, might be marked 
"Ten Dollars."  But the seller probably will accept eight dollars.  By the end of the day, if 
the table has not been sold, the seller probably will accept much less.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Serious buyers also spend time getting ready for yard sales.  They collect the 
newspaper announcements.  Then they make lists of the sales they want to attend.  
Some use maps to plan their trip.  They want to get to as many sales as possible.  
A man who lives near the Middle Western city of Chicago filled his home almost 
completely with  furniture and window coverings from yard sales.  He said he 
was able to travel to Japan with the money he saved. </font>

<br>
New things in stores cost more than some people can pay.  So, they are happy to find 
a painting, a warm coat, or a chair for ten or fifteen dollars.  Perhaps they find dishes for 
twenty dollars that would cost one-hundred dollars in a store. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some  professional dealers in old objects also go to yard sales.  They may find a 
valuable object for a small amount of money.  Then they will re-sell it in their own 
store. . .usually at a much higher price. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Other people go because they enjoy the hunt. They like to find beautiful or unusual 
things that are being sold for less than their value.  They may find a piece of old 
furniture, for example, that is worth a lot of money after it is  repaired.
</font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some people go to yard sales to find a  special thing that they collect.  It may be 
old toy trains, for example, or paintings of dogs.  Experts say more Americans are 
collecting old things now than ever before.  The most popular things to collect are small 
objects: old money,  stamps,  dolls,  bottles, baseball cards, toys and 
advertising signs. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Most people who go to yard sales, however, are not looking for anything special.  
They might buy an object simply because it costs so little.  They enjoy negotiating over 
prices, even if they really do not need the object.  Later, they may hold their own yard 
sale to sell all the things they have bought. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) <br>
<br>
A flea market is similar to a yard sale, only bigger.  Flea markets get their name from 
small,  wingless insects called fleas.  Fleas jump on to animals or humans and hide 
in their hair.  Some people say the expression "flea market" comes from the fear that 
fleas may be hiding in the old things you buy at such a market.  
Some flea markets are  community events.  Many families bring things to sell.  
The event may be held at a school or in a park.  Some schools and  churches hold 
flea markets once a year to  earn money for special projects.  Most flea markets, 
however, are held on weekends during spring, summer, and autumn. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> <br>
Professional dealers' flea markets are more organized than yard sales or community 
flea markets.  Sellers usually must get a trader's  license from the local government.  
They must collect tax on everything they sell. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some people get all their earnings by selling things at flea markets.  Others have 
traditional jobs and earn a little extra money at flea markets.   Some dealers at a flea 
market sell lots of different things.  Others sell just one kind of thing.  It may be glass 
objects or old farm equipment.  Many professional flea markets sell only  antiques.  
In America, things are considered antique if they are at least one-hundred years old.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One of the largest flea markets in the world is held in the state of California. 
On the second Sunday of every month, buyers look at objects offered by more than 
two- thousand sellers. This huge event is the Rose Bowl Flea Market.  It takes place in 
the famous sports center in Pasadena, California.   In sunshine or during rain, sellers 
show all kinds of things: books, records,  fishbowls, seashells, doghouses.  
Arts and  crafts are offered at the Rose Bowl Arts and Crafts Outdoor  Festival, 
in connection with the Rose Bowl Flea Market.  The only objects not permitted for 
sale  include food, animals, and guns. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Another famous market is called "The World's Longest Outdoor Sale."  This event is 
held each year along a road that runs through the southern states of Kentucky, 
Tennessee, and Alabama.  The sale is seven-hundred-twenty-five kilometers long.  
The twelfth yearly sale was held last Thursday through Sunday.  More than two-
thousand people (35)lined up to sell things.  They included antiques, art, farm tools, 
home-made food, even cats and dogs.  Thousands of people stopped their cars and 
looked over the goods at "The World's Longest Outdoor Sale." </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE))<br> 
<br>
To some people, flea markets and yard sales are a sign that Americans are too 
 
concerned with  material possessions.  They ask: Why do people spend so 
much time buying things they probably do not need?  Is it some basic human  desire 
to trade or to get something for almost nothing? </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some people have a strong desire to collect old objects such as toys or dolls.  
Perhaps they may be trying to  recapture the happy times when they were children.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"> <br>
To other people, yard sales are simply a way to have fun.  In some communities, ten 
or twenty families may have a yard sale on the same weekend.  These are important 
social  gatherings.  A busy working mother in Cleveland said she would never have 
met so many people who live near her without yard sales. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Other people say yard sales help the  environment.  Old things are re-used 
instead of being thrown away. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In any case, experts say buying and collecting objects at yard sales and flea markets 
are more popular than ever in America.  Hunting for unusual items is a sport for 
some people.  For others, it is a way of life. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
