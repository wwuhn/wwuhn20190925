<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Millions of people are spending part of their summer holiday visiting national parks 
in the United States.  The National Park Service&nbsp; operates almost four-hundred 
protected areas across the nation.   I'm Sarah Long. </font>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Many Americans say it would not seem like summer without a visit to a national 
park.  But conditions at some of the parks have caused President Bush to announce 
plans for improvements. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The president recently proposed spending almost five-thousand-million dollars over 
five years for structural repairs at the parks.  Bridges, visitor centers and other buildings 
would be improved.  So would systems for heating,&nbsp; electricity and safety. 
Mister Bush also named Fran Mainella as the new National Park Service (4) 
director.  She has been heading the state parks in Florida.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Bush Administration says the national parks need repairs to prevent harm to 
people, wildlife and natural areas.  Environmentalists had criticized the  Administration for placing top importance on structural repairs.  They say it is more 
important to improve air and water quality at the parks. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The administration now has decided to move ahead with a proposal made by  former President Clinton.  This plan is aimed at improving air quality by  reducing 
pollution in many of the parks. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Administration support and  federal money are extremely important to the 
National Park Service. The service was created in Nineteen-Sixteen as part of the 
Department of the&nbsp; Interior. Today the National Park Service operates three-hundred-
eighty-four protected areas across the nation.  These include large areas that offer 
many activities.  They also include monuments, seashores, historical areas, battlefields, 
rivers and walking  trails.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">High gasoline prices have made car travel costly this summer.   But officials say 
about two-hundred-eighty-five-million people will visit almost sixty major national parks 
this season. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Visitors to America's national parks walk in the woods.  They climb ropes, rocks 
and mountains.  They swim, ride horses and visit underground caves.  They attend 
classes about wildlife and history led by experts.   They sleep outdoors in  temporary  shelters.  They prepare food outdoors. They enjoy the beauty and 
wonders of nature.</font><p style="text-align: justify">  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The most popular national parks are the Great Smoky Mountains, the  Grand 
Canyon and&nbsp; Yosemite. Almost eighteen-million people visited these places last year.  
About the same number are expected this year. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is on the border between  North 
Carolina and&nbsp; Tennessee.  A  mist that looks like smoke usually covers the 
mountaintops. The trees help create the  dense wet atmosphere.    
Environmentalists hope new measures to improve air quality will reduce this substance.  
But until this happens, the mountains have earned their name.  
More than ten-million people visit the Great Smoky Mountains each year.  This is 
more than any other national park.  Some of the mountains are about two-thousand 
meters high.  About one-hundred-fifty kinds of trees grow in the park.  People fish in 
many clear rivers.   A number of these rivers have beautiful waterfalls.  
The  Cherokee Indians were the first people to live in the Great Smoky 
Mountains. Later, the first white settlers built houses.  Visitors can see some of these 
very old wooden cabins in the park.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Grand Canyon in Arizona may be the most famous national park in the United 
States.  It  extends four-hundred-fifty kilometers along the Colorado River.  Visitors 
enjoy this beautiful place in many ways. They stand near the edge and look over the  canyon.  They walk or ride a  mule down into the canyon.  They fly over it in 
helicopters or small airplanes.  They ride in boats in the sometimes fast-moving waters 
of the Colorado River. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Grand Canyon is huge, silent, peaceful and deep.  Some visitors say it makes 
them think about their own very small place in the natural world. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Yosemite National Park is in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.  It has 
more than one-thousand kilometers of walking paths.  Most of these trails lead upward 
to mountaintops, rivers and lakes of the High Sierra.   Many animals live there, 
including bears and deer.   Huge ancient  sequoia trees grow in Yosemite.  A tree 
called the Grizzly Giant is two-thousand-seven-hundred years old.  It is thought to be 
the oldest living sequoia tree in the world. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Yosemite Valley, visitors see waterfalls pour down rock walls formed by ancient 
ice mountains.  Bridalveil Falls and Yosemite Falls are among the most famous 
waterfalls.  Huge rocks rise from the floor of the valley. One of these is called El Capitan.  
It is more than one-thousand meters high. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">People can also visit many historic places in the national park system. One of these 
is Alcatraz Island in northern California.  It is in the Golden Gate National  Recreation Area in San Francisco Bay.  In the Eighteen-Hundreds, the United States 
Army built a major defense center on the island.  During the Civil War in the Eighteen-
Sixties, this center helped protect San Francisco from the  Confederate army.  
But Alcatraz is most famous as a top-security federal prison.  A few famous 
criminals like Al Capone served sentences there.  The prison closed in Nineteen-Sixty-
Three.  Six years later a group of Native Americans&nbsp; occupied the island for 
nineteen months.  They seized the island to show the problems of American Indians. 
VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts is another national protected 
area.  It is sixty-four kilometers long.  There are no stores or other businesses.  
Visitors enjoy a peaceful ocean area.    Seagulls and other birds fly over sandy 
shores. Tall grass and wildflowers grow in the sand.  One of the many swimming areas 
is close to a historic spot.  In this area Guglielmo Marconi built radio towers in the early 
Nineteen-Hundreds.  He successfully sent and received radio signals across the 
Atlantic Ocean with this equipment. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico protects the  ruins of 
a complex ancient civilization. The Chacoan culture began more than one-thousand-one-
hundred years ago.  The Chacoan people built huge houses.  The largest of these 
contained more than six-hundred rooms.  Experts believe the people used these 
buildings for ceremonies, meeting and trading.</font><p style="text-align: justify">  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The national park also protects the night sky above Chaco Canyon. The ancient 
Chacoan people observed the movement of planets and stars.  This helped them plan 
ceremonies and design their buildings.  Today park workers reduce lighting so visitors 
can get a clear look at the night skies. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park is in Ohio.  It honors Orville 
and Wilbur Wright.  They invented the first successful airplane.  Visitors can see the 
building where the brothers operated their bicycle  manufacturing and printing 
businesses.  It also is where they created plans for their airplane.  They first flew it in 
North Carolina in Nineteen-Oh-Three. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The park also honors the Wright brothers' friend Paul Laurence Dunbar. Mister 
Dunbar was a famous African American writer of novels, poems, plays, and short stories.   
The Wright brothers published a newspaper Mister Dunbar wrote for the African 
American  community. A memorial to Mister Dunbar is in the home he bought for his 
mother.  Visitors can see historic objects including a bicycle made for him by Orville and 
Wilbur Wright. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Americans hope the National Park Service will continue to operate and protect their 
special places.  Composer Ferde Grofe (FUR-dee Grow-FAY) liked one of the parks so 
much that he wrote music about it.   It is called the "Grand Canyon Suite."
