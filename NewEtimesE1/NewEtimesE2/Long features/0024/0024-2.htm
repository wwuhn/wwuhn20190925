<H3 style="text-align: center"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="top"></a>VISITING WASHINGTON</font></H3>
<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">By Jerilyn Watson
</font> </p>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">More than twenty-million people visited the capital of the United States last 
year. Many people who live in Washington, D. C. , take their visitors around the 
city, especially during spring and summer. I'm Steve Ember. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And I'm Shirley Griffith. A visit to Washington, D. C. is our story today on 
the VOA Special English program, THIS IS AMERICA. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((THEME))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is August. An education advisor in the Washington area, Suzy Karpel 
(car-PELL), gets a phone call. Friends from the Middle West are coming to visit.
</font> 

<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">There are four members in the family. They say they want to see the city. 
They want to see everything. But they can stay only a day or two. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mizz Karpel knows they cannot possibly see everything in such a short time. 
She knows that the weather may be very hot. She knows their feet will get tired. 
But she wants her visitors to have wonderful memories of their visit. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mizz Karpel decides they will do most of their travelling by using the city 
public transportation system, the Metro, instead of her car. This will save time 
in traffic. It also will avoid the problem of finding a place to leave the car.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The group plans to see museums during the day, and visit outdoor memorials at 
night. That way, they will be inside buildings during the hottest part of the 
day. But which of the many Washington museums should they see? And what will 
they choose to see in each one? </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The visitors have two children. So Mizz Karpel decides they should begin 
their visit at the National Museum of Natural History. The museum is part of the 
Smithsonian Institution. It is along the green area called the Mall in the 
center of Washington. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Natural History Museum contains objects about human cultures and mineral 
sciences. It also explains the biological sciences. And, it presents research 
about plants and animals. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The children are excited at seeing the dinosaurs, like the fierce looking 
Triceratops that disappeared from Earth long ago. Some huge creatures in the 
museum are copies. Others are bones of real creatures that scientists have put 
together. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">One of the areas the visitors like best in the Natural History Museum is the 
Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals. Here, the famous huge, blue Hope Diamond 
shines brightly from a container that keeps turning so the jewel can be seen 
from all sides. Many people crowd into the geology hall, trying to see all the 
beautiful jewels. The visitors enjoy the nearby area showing uncut minerals of 
bright beautiful colors. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The group now walks along the Mall to the nearby National Museum of American 
History. This museum has millions of objects important to the development of the 
United States. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Some of them are well known: dresses of the wives of American presidents or 
the walking stick given to George Washington by Benjamin Franklin. The visitors 
also enjoy objects that are not as well known. One of these is the table on 
which Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 
Seventeen-Seventy-Six. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Next, the group visits the National Air and Space Museum. It is the most 
popular museum in the world. Here, the family looks at the command vehicle of 
the Apollo Eleven spacecraft that first landed on the moon in 
Nineteen-Sixty-Nine. And they all have a chance to touch a rock from the moon.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">By now, everyone is hungry and a little tired. To save time, they buy some 
food at an eating place in the museum. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">After eating lunch, the visitors decide they do not have the time or energy 
to see the National Gallery of Art. Instead they visit a smaller art museum, the 
Freer Gallery of Art. It contains art from Asia and the United States. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">At the Freer, they inspect an unusual room. It is called the Peacock Room. 
James McNeill Whistler painted it. Large golden birds with shining tail feathers 
are painted on the walls. Blue and white containers line walls covered with 
leather material. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The last stop for Mizz Karpel and her visitors is the Bureau of Engraving and 
Printing. American paper money is produced in this building. Bureau workers also 
print treasury notes, military documents and postage stamps. The children are 
able to buy sheets of uncut money. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">By now, everyone is ready for some quiet time and dinner. They return to Mizz 
Karpel's home by Metro. After resting and eating, they start out again. They 
will ride in Mizz Karpel's car to see the city's famous memorials. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Now it is getting dark. The visitors will do some of their sightseeing by 
moonlight, when the temperature is cooler. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">They start at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. This memorial honors 
the American president who served longest in office -- from 
Nineteen-Thirty-Three until his death in Nineteen-Forty-Five. His memorial 
opened in Nineteen-Ninety-Seven. It contains four large areas. Each area 
represents one of his terms in office. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The group then goes to the Korean War Veterans' Memorial. It honors those who 
served in the Korean conflict, from Nineteen-Fifty to Nineteen-Fifty-Three.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Statues of soldiers wearing battle clothing stand in the center of this 
memorial. Lights shine on their faces. They look very real. They look as though 
they might move at any moment. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">From there, the visitors walk to the Lincoln Memorial. Abraham Lincoln was 
the sixteenth president of the United States. He led the nation through the 
Civil War. His memorial is a huge, white building. It is partly open so you can 
see from a distance the larger-than-life size statue of the president. He is 
seated. He looks toward a body of water called the Reflecting Pool. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Next the group walks by the black wall of the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. On 
the wall are the names of the more than fifty-eight-thousand Americans who died 
in the Vietnam War. Many people leave flowers and notes at this memorial. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">After all the walking, Mizz Karpel's group is glad to return to her car. Now 
they will drive around the Jefferson Memorial. This monument honors the third 
president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A statue of him stands in the middle of a circular building. On this moonlit 
night, our visitors can see the image of the memorial in the water of the Tidal 
Basin. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mizz Karpel then drives by the Washington Monument. It honors George 
Washington, the first president of the United States. The Washington Monument is 
made of white stone. Its narrow form reaches more than one-hundred-sixty-nine 
meters toward the sky. It is late now, and the visitors decide to end their day.
</font> 

<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The next morning, Mizz Karpel's group is up early to get in line for free 
tickets to visit the White House. This building has been home to every American 
President except George Washington. After waiting in line, the visitors walk 
through five main public rooms, including the red room, the blue room and the 
east room. In that room, the wife of President John Adams once hung the family's 
clothes after they were washed. Today it is used for parties and other events 
requiring a large space. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Before they leave Washington, the visitors want to see the Capitol. They 
enter the famous building where American laws are made. They visit the large 
rooms where members of the House of Representatives and the Senate meet to 
discuss and vote on laws. And they see the paintings and statues that fill the 
long halls of the Capitol. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Later that day, Mizz Karpel's visitors will end their visit and fly home. 
They saw many interesting things in Washington. Yet there are many more places 
they would like to see. Among them are the United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum, the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court of the United States and the 
National Zoo. So the visitors begin a list of places to see on a future trip to 
Washington. And Mizz Karpel tries to get some rest before her next visitors 
arrive ready to see the nation's capital. </font>
