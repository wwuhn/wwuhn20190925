<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><b><u><a name="casey jones"></a>Casey Jones - The Union 
Scab</u><br>
</b>(Tune: Casey Jones)<br>
<br>
Written by Joe Hill<br>
(IWW Song Book 1912 Edition)<br>
<br>
The Workers on the S. P. line to strike sent out a call;<br>
But Casey Jones, the engineer, he wouldn't strike at all;<br>
His boiler it was leaking, and its drivers on the bum,<br>
And his engine and its bearings, they were all out of plumb.<br>
<br>
Casey Jones kept his junk pile running;<br>
Casey Jones was working double time;<br>
Cagey Jones got a wooden medal,<br>
For being good and faithful on the S.P. line.<br>
<br>
The workers said to Casey: &quot;Won't you help us win this strike ? &quot;<br>
But Casey said: &quot;Let me alone, you'd better take a hike.&quot;<br>
Then Casey's wheezy engine ran right off the worn-out track,<br>
And Casey hit the river with an awful crack.<br>
<br>
Casey Jones hit the river bottom;<br>
Casey Jones broke his blooming spine;<br>
Casey Jones was an Angeleno,<br>
He took a trip to heaven on the S. P. line.<br>
<br>
When Casey Jones got up to heaven to the Pearly Gate,<br>
He said: &quot;I'm Casey Jones, the guy that pulled the S. P. freight.&quot;<br>
&quot;You're just the man,&quot; said Peter, &quot;our musicians went on strike;<br>
You can get a job a-scabbing any time you like.&quot;<br>
<br>
Casey Jones got a job in heaven;<br>
Casey Jones was doing mighty fine;<br>
Casey Jones went scabbing on the angels,<br>
Just like he did to workers on the S. P. line.<br>
<br>
They got together and they said it wasn't fair<br>
For Casey Jones to go around a-scabbing everywhere.<br>
The Angel Union No. 23 they sure were there,<br>
And they promptly fired Casey down the Golden Stair.<br>
<br>
Casey Jones went to Hell a-flying;<br>
Casey Jones, the Devil said, &quot;Oh fine;<br>
Casey Jones, get busy shoveling sulfur<br>
That's what you get for scabbing on the S.P. Line.&quot;<br>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,<br>
Alive as you or me<br>
Says I, &quot;But Joe, you're ten years dead,&quot;<br>
&quot;I never died,&quot; says he<br>
&quot;I never died,&quot; says he<br>
<br>
&quot;In Salt Lake, Joe,&quot; says I to him,<br>
Him satnding by my bed,<br>
&quot;They framed you on a murder charge,&quot;<br>
Says Joe, &quot;But I ain't dead,&quot;<br>
Says Joe, &quot;But I ain't dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The copper bosses killed you, Joe,<br>
They shot you, Joe,&quot; says I.<br>
&quot;Takes more than guns to kill a man,&quot;<br>
Says Joe, &quot;I didn't die,&quot;<br>
Says Joe, &quot;I didn't die.&quot;<br>
<br>
And standing there as big as life<br>
And smiling with his eyes<br>
Joe says, &quot;What they forgot to kill<br>
Went on to organize,<br>
Went on to organize.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Joe Hill ain't dead,&quot; he says to me,<br>
&quot;Joe Hill ain't never died.<br>
Where working men are out on strike<br>
Joe Hill is at their side,<br>
Joe Hill is at their side.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;From San Diego up to Maine,<br>
In every mine and mill,<br>
Where workers strike and organize,&quot;<br>
Says he, &quot;You'll find Joe Hill,&quot;<br>
Says he, &quot;You'll find Joe Hill.&quot;<br>
<br>
I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,<br>
Alive as you or me<br>
Says I, &quot;But Joe, you're ten years dead,&quot;<br>
&quot;I never died,&quot; says he<br>
&quot;I never died,&quot; says he<br>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Music by Earl Robinson, copyright 1938 by Bob Miller, Inc.<br>
Joe Hill, a great organizer and poet, was executed in 1915 on a murder charge 
which union circles have always considered a frame-up. This song, written in his 
memory, is one of the most moving of all the labor songs.</font></p>

<u><font face="Times New Roman"><b><a name="solidarity"><font size="4"></font></a>
<font size="4">Solidarity forever<br>
</font>
</b></font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br>
chorus: Solidarity forever, solidarity forever, solidarity forever<br>
For the Union makes us strong. <br>
<br>
1. When the union's inspiration<br>
Through the workers' blood shall run,<br>
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun,<br>
Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one,<br>
For the Union makes us strong.<br>
<br>
chorus: Solidarity forever, solidarity forever, solidarity forever,<br>
For the Union makes us strong.<br>
<br>
2. Is there ought we hold in common<br>
With the greedy parasite?<br>
Who would lash us into serfdom<br>
And would crush us with his might,<br>
Is there anything left to us<br>
But to organize and fight?<br>
For the union makes us strong.<br>
<br>
3. It is we who ploughed the prairies,<br>
Built the cities where they trade,<br>
Dug the mines and built the workshops,<br>
Endless miles of railroad laid;<br>
Now we stand outcast and starving,<br>
'Mid the wonders we have made,<br>
But the Union makes us strong.<br>
<br>
4. All the world that's owned by idle drones<br>
Is ours and ours alone,<br>
We have laid the wide foundations<br>
Built it skyward, stone by stone<br>
It is ours! Not to slave in<br>
But to master and to own<br>
While the union makes us strong.<br>
<br>
5. They have taken untold millions<br>
That they never toiled to earn,<br>
But without our brain and muscle<br>
Not a single wheel can turn;<br>
We can break their haughty power,<br>
Gain our freedom when we learn<br>
That the Union makes us strong.<br>
<br>
6. In our hands is placed a power,<br>
Greater than their hoarded gold,<br>
Greater than the might of atoms,<br>
Magnified a thousand fold;<br>
We can bring to birth a new world,<br>
From the ashes of the old<br>
For the Union makes us strong.<br>
<br>
