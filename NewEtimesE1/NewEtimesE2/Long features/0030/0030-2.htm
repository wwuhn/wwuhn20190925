<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And I'm Steve Ember with the VOA Special English program, PEOPLE IN AMERICA. 
Today we tell about the life of Nineteenth Century philosopher and writer Ralph 
Waldo Emerson. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States had won its independence from Britain just twenty-two years 
before Ralph Waldo Emerson was born. But it had yet to win its cultural 
independence. It still took its traditions from other countries, mostly from 
western Europe. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">What the American Revolution did for the nation's politics, Emerson did for 
its culture. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When he began writing and speaking in the Eighteen-Thirties, conservatives 
saw him as radical -- wild and dangerous. But to the young, he spoke words of 
self-dependence -- a new language of freedom. He was the first to bring them a 
truly American spirit. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">He told America to demand its own laws and churches and works. It is through 
his own works that we shall look at Ralph Waldo Emerson. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ralph Waldo Emerson's life was not as exciting as the lives of some other 
American writers -- Herman Melville, Mark Twain or Ernest Hemingway. Emerson 
traveled to Europe several times. And he made speeches at a number of places in 
the United States. But, except for those trips, he lived all his life in the 
small town of Concord, Massachusetts. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">He once said that the shortest books are those about the lives of people with 
great minds. Emerson was not speaking about himself. Yet his own life proves the 
thought. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson was born in the northeastern city of Boston, Massachusetts, in 
Eighteen-Oh-Three. Boston was then the capital of learning in the United States.
</font> 

<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson's father, like many of the men in his family, was a minister of a 
Christian church. When Emerson was eleven years old, his father died. Missus 
Emerson was left with very little money to raise her five sons. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">After several more years in Boston, the family moved to the nearby town of 
Concord. There they joined Emerson's aunt, Mary Moody Emerson. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson seemed to accept the life his mother and aunt wanted for him. As a 
boy, he attended Boston Latin School. Then he studied at Harvard University.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For a few years, he taught in a girls' school started by one of his brothers. 
But he did not enjoy this kind of teaching. For a time, he wondered what he 
should do with his life. Finally, like his father, he became a religious 
minister. But he had questions about his beliefs and the purpose of his life.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Eighteen-Thirty-One, Ralph Waldo Emerson resigned as the minister of his 
church because of a minor religious issue. What really troubled him was 
something else. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It was his growing belief that a person could find God without the help of an 
organized church. He believed that God is not found in systems and words, but in 
the minds of people. He said that God in us worships God. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson travelled to Europe the following year. He talked about his ideas 
with the best-known European writers and thinkers of his time. When he returned 
to the United States, he married and settled in Concord. Then he began his life 
as a writer and speaker. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ralph Waldo Emerson published his first book, Nature, in Eighteen-Thirty-Six. 
It made conservatives see him as a revolutionary. But students at Harvard 
University liked the book and invited him to speak to them. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">His speech, "The American Scholar," created great excitement among the 
students. They heard his words as a new declaration of independence -- a 
declaration of the independence of the mind. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">"Give me an understanding of today's world," he told them, "and you may have 
the worlds of the past and the future. Show me where God is hidden...as 
always...in nature. What is near explains what is far. A drop of water is a 
small ocean. Each of us is a part of all of nature." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson said a sign of the times was the new importance given to each person. 
"The world," he said, "is nothing. The person is all. In yourself is the law of 
all nature." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson urged students to learn directly from life. He told them, "Life is 
our dictionary." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The following year, Emerson was invited to speak to students and teachers at 
the Harvard religious school. In his speech, he called for moral and spiritual 
rebirth. But his words shocked members of Harvard's traditional Christian 
church. He said churches treated religion as if God were dead. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">"Let mankind stand forevermore," he said, "as a temple returned to greatness 
by new love, new faith, new sight." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Church members who heard him speak called him a man who did not believe in 
God. Almost thirty years passed before Harvard invited Emerson to speak there 
again. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Away from Harvard, Emerson's speeches became more and more popular. He was 
able to make his living by writing and speaking. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">"Do you understand Mister Emerson?" a Boston woman asked her servant. "Not a 
word," the servant answered. "But I like to go and see him speak. He stands up 
there and looks as if he thought everyone was as good as he was." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Many people, especially the young, did understand Emerson. His ideas seemed 
right for a new country just beginning to enjoy its independence -- a country 
expanding in all directions. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Young people agreed with Emerson that a person had the power within himself 
to succeed at whatever he tried. The important truth seemed to be not what had 
been done, but what might be done. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In a speech called "Self-Reliance" Ralph Waldo Emerson told his listeners, 
"Believe your own thoughts, believe that what is true for you in your private 
heart is true for all men." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson said society urges us to act carefully. This, he said, restricts our 
freedom of action. "It is always easy to agree," he said. "Yet nothing is more 
holy than the independence of your own mind. Let a person know his own value. 
Have no regrets. Nothing can bring you peace but yourselves." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Eighteen-Fifties were not a peaceful time for America. The nation was 
divided by a bitter argument about slavery. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Most people in the South defended slavery. They believed the agricultural 
economy of the South depended on Negro slaves. Most people in the North 
condemned slavery. They believed it was wrong for one man to own another. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson was not interested in debates or disputes. But he was prepared to 
defend truth, as he saw it. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson believed that the slaves should be freed. But he did not take an 
active part in the anti-slavery movement. All his beliefs about the individual 
opposed the idea of group action -- even group action against slavery. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">As the dispute became more intense, however, Emerson finally, quietly, added 
his voice to the anti-slavery campaign. When one of his children wrote a school 
report about building a house, he said no one should build a house without a 
place to hide runaway slaves. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson's health began to fail in the early Eighteen-Seventies. His house was 
partly destroyed by fire. He and his wife escaped. But the shock was great. 
Friends gave him money to travel to Egypt with his daughter. While he was gone, 
they rebuilt his house. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emerson returned to Concord. But his health did not improve. He could no 
longer work. In April, Eighteen-Eighty-Two, he became sick with pneumonia. He 
died on April Twenty-Seventh. He was seventy-nine years old. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ralph Waldo Emerson's death was national news. In Concord and other places, 
people hung black cloth on houses and public buildings as a sign of mourning. 
His friends in Concord walked to the church for his funeral service. They 
carried branches of the pine trees that Emerson loved. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">After the funeral, Ralph Waldo Emerson was buried in Concord near the graves 
of two other important early American writers -- Henry David Thoreau and 
Nathaniel Hawthorne. </font>
