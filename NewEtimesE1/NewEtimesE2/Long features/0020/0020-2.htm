 <p style="text-align: center"><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Jerilyn Watson
 
VOICE ONE: </font></i> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The American family is changing. Many people in the United States are forming 
different kinds of families than in the past.  I'm Sarah Long. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And I'm Shirley Griffith.  We tell about changes in family life and their  effects on 
the nation on the VOA Special English program THIS IS AMERICA. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((THEME)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Sixty, forty-five percent of American homes had married parents with 
children under the age of eighteen.  Population experts call this a  traditional family.  
By Two-Thousand, fewer than twenty-five percent of American homes had these 
traditional families. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States Census Bureau counts the population every ten years.  It 
also tells how Americans live.  The Census of Two-Thousand reports many changes in 
the American family from the last census ten years ago.  It reports that married men and 
women occupy more than half of American homes.  But it also shows that more children 
live with only one parent than ten years ago.  Other children live with a mother and 
father who are not married.  Many of these children share homes with children not 
related to them. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
 <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Still other people may live with many family members.   And more people of the 
same sex are making a home together in the United States today. </font>   
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Census officials reported these  observations last month.  They say the changing 
American family will have important effects on government, education and business.
</font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Population experts give several reasons for the decreased number of traditional 
families.  For example, young Americans today are not in a hurry to  establish 
traditional families. Most women do not have to marry for  financial  security.  They 
have good jobs and can  support themselves.  Men and women are marrying later in 
life than they did ten years ago.  These couples also are having children later.  
Both women and men now are living longer than they once did.  This means many 
married couples will spend years together after their children have grown and left home.

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Census officials say the number of people living alone increased in the Nineteen-
Nineties. More than twenty-seven-million people live alone.  This is about twenty-six 
percent of the population. Some people who live alone choose never to marry.  Others 
live alone before marrying, or after a marriage has failed.  Other people who live alone 
are over the age of sixty-five. Many of these people live by themselves because their 
husbands or wives have died. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States has more than one-hundred-million homes, also called 
households.  The Census of Two-Thousand shows that homes headed by single 
mothers increased twenty-five percent during the Nineteen-Nineties.   There are now 
more than seven-million single mothers.  This is a result of the high rate of marriages 
that end in  divorce.  It also is a result of the high rate of unmarried women having 
babies.  During most of the past ten years, about one-third of all babies born in the 
United States were born to unmarried women. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Some public officials and  policy  organizations fear the effects of the 
increase in such families on government.  They say these families will make added 
demands on social service agencies.  This is because many single mothers earn 
less money than two-parent families. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Single fathers now head about two-million American homes.  This is a big increase 
from ten years ago.  Like single mothers, single fathers also can have financial 
problems. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For example, a thirty-six-year-old man works for a  Maryland computer company.  
He and his wife ended their marriage a year ago.  The court decided that the couple's 
two-year-old daughter would live with the father. He is happy to have his little girl live with 
him.  But he says he is always worrying about money.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">He pays  separate housing  expenses for himself and his  former wife.  
He pays someone to care for his daughter while he works.  But sometimes his daughter 
is sick and cannot go to the care  provider.  So he had to bring the child to his office 
several times.   He says he could lose his job if this happens too often. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Dorian Solot is a leader of the  Alternatives to Marriage Project in 
 
Boston,  Massachusetts.   She helped organize the project in Nineteen-Ninety-
Eight to advise unmarried people.  Its members include single people, unmarried 
couples and couples of the same sex. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Years ago, many Americans said they strongly  disapproved of unmarried 
couples living together. More recent  opinion studies have shown that many people 
no longer feel this way.  Perhaps this is one reason that the number of unmarried 
couples has increased seventy-one percent since Nineteen-Ninety. There are now 
eleven-million unmarried people living with a  partner.</font><p style="text-align: justify">  
 <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mizz Solot says she expects more unmarried couples to live together in the future.  
But she says there is still great  pressure on them to marry. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Family Research Council in Washington, D-C has expressed concern about 
children living with unmarried parents.  It reports the results of a Nineteen-Ninety-Seven 
study of American families.  The study says these children are more likely to be poor.  
It says they are less likely to do well in school.  And the report says they may have  
emotional problems later in life. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A mental health expert for the public schools in  Montgomery County, Maryland, 
works with children from several kinds of  nontraditional homes.   She says these 
children are sometimes poorly supervised.  Sometimes a number of different people 
care for them. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Often their caretakers are other children.   Some children have no&nbsp; 
supervision at all.  Money problems can force their families to move from place to place. 
This means the children must change schools often.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">However, the mental health expert says many nontraditional families are happy and 
successful.  She says children do best when they receive continued loving care from 
the same  adults.  She believes this is true no matter who the adults may be.    
VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The National Education  Association is a union that  represents American 
teachers.  The association  urges schools to help parents and children of 
nontraditional families.  It points to the example of the Ensley Elementary School in 
Pensacola,  Florida.  The school is in one of the poorest areas of the United States.   
It has many nontraditional families.   A high number of students move into and out of 
the area every year. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Florida state educators and a parent group have joined forces to improve student 
life at Ensley Elementary School.   The goal is to develop strong relations between the 
school and the parents. </font>    <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: For example, classes after school show parents how to use 
computers.   This prepares them to help their children with school work.  Other classes 
train mothers and fathers to work with children who do poorly on tests.  Parents can 
borrow books and teaching materials from the school. Men in the community provide a 
male presence to children whose own fathers do not live with them.  These men 
help teachers in classrooms.  They organize special  money-raising events.   They 
also do needed repair work at the school. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Over the years, many American businesses have presented their sales messages 
for traditional families. They designed this&nbsp; advertising for married people with 
children. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Some businesses continue to target advertising to the traditional family.  For 
example, many food ads show such families. Other businesses, however, direct their 
sales messages to nontraditional households. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For example, a current television advertisement for a large investment company is 
aimed at single mothers.  It shows the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson.  She is the 
former wife of Britain's Prince Andrew.  Now she is a divorced mother. She is telling a 
bedtime story to a little girl.  The story is about a beautiful young woman and a brave 
warrior long ago. The knight marries the woman, takes her to his castle and 
gives her everything she needs. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">But then Sarah Ferguson tells the little girl that she should learn about&nbsp; 
investing her money.  She says this is important because people sometimes do not live 
happily ever after. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
