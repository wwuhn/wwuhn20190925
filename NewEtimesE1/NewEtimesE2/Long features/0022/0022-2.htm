   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Announcer:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">People in America -- a program in special English about famous Americans 
of the past.  Now, Kay Gallant and Harry Monroe tell the story of nineteenth 
century poet, Emily Dickinson.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(Theme)</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Because I could not stop for death--<br>
   He kindly stopped for me-- <br>
   The carriage held but just ourselves<br>
   And immortality. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The words are by American poet Emily Dickinson, who died in eighteen-
eighty-six.
  During her life, she  published only about ten poems.
  Four years after her death, a few more poems were published.
  But her complete work did not appear until nineteen-fifty-five.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I'm nobody!  Who are you? <br>  Are you -- nobody -- too?</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emily Dickinson has become part of our language without really being part 
of our history.  Some see her as the last poet of an early American 
 
tradition.  Others see her as the first modern American poet.  Each reader 
seems to find a different Emily Dickinson.  She remains as&nbsp; mysterious as 
she was when she was alive.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Tell all the truth but tell it  slant--</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The truth about Emily Dickinson has been difficult to discover. Few 
people of her time knew who she was or what she was doing. The main facts 
about her life are these.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">She was born December tenth, eighteen-thirty, in the small Massachusetts 
town of Amherst.  She lived and died in the same house where she was born.  
Emily received a good education.  She studied  philosophy, the Latin 
language, and the science of plants and rocks.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emily's parents were important people in Amherst.  Many famous visitors 
came to their house, and Emily met them.  Her father was a well-known lawyer 
who was elected to  congress for one term.   Mister Dickinson believed that 
women should be educated.  But he also believed that women should not use 
their education to work outside the home.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">He felt their one and only  task was to care for their husband and 
children.  Emily once said:  he buys me many books, but begs me not to read 
them, because he fears they upset the mind."</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emily wrote more than one-thousand seven-hundred poems. There are three 
books of her letters.  And there are many books about her life.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Some of her best work was written in the four years between eighteen 
fifty-eight and eighteen-sixty-two.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I live with him--I see his face--<br>
   I go no more away<br>
   For visitor--or sundown--<br>
   Death's single  privacy<br>
       Dreams--are well--but waking's better,<br>
   If one wake at morn--<br>
   If one wake at midnight--better--<br>
   Dreaming--of the dawn--<br>
    This is my letter to the world<br>
   That never wrote to me--<br>
   The simple news that nature told--<br>
   With tender majesty<br>
   Voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In those years, Emily seems to have found her "voice" as a poet. She 
settled into forms she used for the rest of her life.  The forms are similar 
to those of religious music used during her lifetime.  But her choice of 
words was unusual.  She wrote that her dictionary was her best friend.
   Other influences were the English poet, William Shakespeare; the 
Christian holy book, the bible; and the forces of nature.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I dreaded that first robin so,<br>
   But he is mastered now,<br>
   And I'm accustomed to him grown--<br>
   He hurts a little though<br>
   I dared not meet the daffodils,<br>
   For fear their yellow gown   Would pierce me with a fashion   So 
foreign to my own.<br>
   I could not bear the bees should come,<br>
   I wished they'd stay away<br>
   In those dim countries where they go:<br>
   What word had they for me?</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice two: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Throughout her life, Emily asked men for advice.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And then she did not follow what they told her.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">As a child, there was her father.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Later there was her father's law partner, and a churchman she met in 
the city of  Philadelphia. Another man who helped her was the writer Thomas 
Wentworth Higgins on.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Higgins on had written a magazine story giving advice to young, 
unpublished writers.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emily wrote to him when she was in her early thirties.  She included a 
few poems.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Higgins on wrote back and later visited Emily in Amherst.  In the next 
few years, Emily sent him many more poems.  But he did not have them published, 
and admitted that he did not understand Emily's poetry.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one;</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">'tis not that dying hurts us so--<br>
   'tis living hurts us more;<br>
   But dying is a different way,<br>
   A kind behind the door--</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Some historians wish that Emily's poems had reached the best American 
writers of her day,  Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau or Walt Whitman.  
These men could have over-looked her strange way of living to see only her 
ability.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Historians also say it is possible that Emily chose to write to someone 
like Higgins on so she would not be understood.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To hear an  oriole sing   May be a common thing   Or only a 
divine   It is not the bird   Who sings the same unheard,   As unto crowd.
   Voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">So little is know about Emily's life that many writers have created a life 
for her.  They talk about the things that interest them as if they interested 
Emily, too.  But one writer says part of the joy in studying Emily is what we 
cannot know.  Emily herself said, "I never try to lift the words which I 
cannot hold."</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I cannot live with you,<br>
   It would be life,<br>
   And life is over there<br>
   Behind the shelf<br>
   So we must keep apart<br>
   You there, I here,<br>
   With just the door ajar<br>
   That oceans are,<br>
   And prayer,<br>
   And that pale  sustenance,<br>
   Despair!<br>
   Voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Emily Dickinson sewed the pages of her poems together with thread and put 
them away.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">She also seems to have sewed her life together and put it away, too.
  Step by step, she withdrew from the world.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">As she grew older, she saw fewer visitors, and rarely left her house.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The time of Emily's  withdrawal was also the time of the American civil 
war.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The events that changed America's history, however, did not touch her.  She 
died in eighteen-eighty-six, at the age of fifty-five completely unknown to 
the world.   No one wrote about Emily Dickinson's poems while she was alive. 
Yet, in the hundred years since her death, she has come to be seen as one of 
America's greatest poets.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The brain is wider than the sky,<br>
   For, put them side by side,<br>
   The one the other will contain   <br>
   With ease--and you beside. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
    <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice two:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">After Emily died, her sister Lavonia found Emily's poems locked away.
  Lavonia wrote to Thomas Wentworth Higgins on and demanded that the poems 
be published.  Higgins on agreed.  And a few of Emily's poems about nature were 
published.  Slowly, more and more of her poems were published.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Readers soon learned that she was much more than a nature poet.   In her 
life, Emily was an  opponent of organized religion.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
  <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Yet she often wrote about religion.  She rarely left home.
  Yet she often wrote about faraway places.  She lived quietly.
  Yet she wrote that life passes quickly and should be lived to the fullest.
   Will we ever know more about the life of Emily Dickinson?  As she told a 
friend once:  "in a life that stopped guessing, you and I should not feel at 
home."</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">We have the poems.  And for most readers, they are enough.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Voice one:</font><p style="text-align: justify">
   <font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Surgeons must be very careful<br>
   When they take the knife!<br>
   Underneath their fine incisions<br>
   Stirs the culprit--life</font><p style="text-align: justify">
