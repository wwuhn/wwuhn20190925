And this is Shirley Griffith with the VOA Special English program EXPLORATIONS.  
Today, we will tell about Near Earth Objects.  These are objects made of rock or ice that 
travel in space.  Their orbits around the sun often bring them near Earth.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">  
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the southwestern American state of Arizona there is a huge, round hole in the 
ground.  This kind of hole is called a  crater.  The crater is named for Daniel 
Barringer, the first scientist to study it. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Barringer Crater is more than forty-five meters across.  It is two-hundred-
thirteen meters deep.  It is in the shape of an almost perfect circle. 
Scientists say the event that caused this hole took place about fifty-thousand years 
ago.  In studying the crater, they found evidence that an object from space traveling 
at more than sixty-four thousand kilometers an hour crashed into the ground.  
Scientists say the object was made of the metals iron and nickel.  It was 
about forty-five meters across and weighed several thousand tons.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The rock from space that created the Barringer Crater hit the Earth with the force of 
about twenty-million tons of explosives.  It caused tons of rock and dirt to be thrown 
into the air.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Huge rocks fell back to earth for many kilometers around the huge hole.  Some of 
these rocks are as large as houses.  The force of the object hitting the Earth killed all 
living things within one-hundred kilometers. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">  
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Barringer Crater is only one of about one-hundred-twenty known examples of 
damage caused to the Earth by objects from space.  The crater was the first one to 
be recognized as caused by something from space. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Workers who discovered pieces of the space rock that created the huge hole 
identified it in the Nineteen-Twenties.  Since the Nineteen-Sixties, scientists have 
discovered more evidence to confirm that a space object did cause the Barringer 
Crater.  They found evidence of massive pressure and extreme heat 
caused by an explosion. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists say it is hard to find evidence of damage caused by space objects 
because as the years pass, wind, rain, ice, snow and other weather conditions change 
the land.  Huge holes like the Barringer Crater are filled with rocks, dirt, plants or 
perhaps water.  Many years later any evidence of damage is well hidden. 
The Barringer Crater has not changed much from the time it was created.  This is 
because the space rock hit the Earth in an area of very dry desert.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The huge object that created the Barringer Crater caused a great deal of 
damage.  Yet the damage was only in a local area.  If an object that size hit a modern 
city, it would cause massive damage and loss of life. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In July of Nineteen-Oh-Eight, a huge space rock exploded near the area of Siberia 
called Tunguska.  Russian scientists believe this was the largest object from space to 
hit the Earth in the past two-thousand years. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A huge forest was destroyed, but no one was injured or killed in Tunguska.  
Scientists never found a crater or pieces of the space rock that caused the explosion.  
They believe it exploded as it got very near the ground.  The explosion was so huge that 
devices in Germany which measure earthquakes recorded the event.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists now know that much larger space rocks have hit Earth than those 
involved in Tunguska or Barringer.  Tests show that a huge space object may have hit 
the area near the Gulf of Mexico about sixty-five million years ago.  Scientists 
say the object was so large that it caused millions of tons of dirt and dust to rise in the 
atmosphere.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The scientists believe the dirt and dust blocked sunlight from reaching the ground 
for a very long time.  Plants died from the lack of sunlight. Animals who ate these 
plants had no food and they died also.  The lack of sunlight caused the planet to cool.  
Many areas became extremely cold.  Millions of animals died because of the cold.  
Many scientists say there is strong evidence to suggest that this event may have 
killed almost seventy percent of everything living on Earth.  It probably killed all of the 
huge reptiles called dinosaurs that then ruled the Earth. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists say the Earth has been hit by objects from space many times in the past, 
and that it will be hit again in the future. They have a saying about these kinds of 
events.  They say the question is not "will a space object ever hit the Earth again."  
They say the question is "when will the Earth be hit." </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists call objects in space that come near our planet, "Near Earth Objects."  
They are mainly of two kinds--asteroids or comets.  Asteroids are usually 
made of carbon or minerals. Comets are usually made of ice and rock. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists have identified about two-thousand Near Earth Objects in orbit now.  Of 
these, three-hundred-nine travel near Earth and are considered possible threats to our 
planet.  They are called Potentially Hazardous Asteroids-or P-H-As.  
This does not mean all three-hundred-nine P-H-As will hit the Earth.  It means only 
that it is possible they could.  Space experts in many countries closely observe these P-
H-As. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Earthquakes are measured by an international system known as the Richter 
Scale.  The Richter scale measures how strong an Earthquake is when it happens.  
The higher the number on the Richter scale, the stronger the earthquake and the more 
damage it can cause.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists who study Near Earth Objects and P-H-As have a similar method 
to measure the threat of asteroids and comets.  It is called the Torino Scale.  
Richard Benzel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created the Torino 
Scale.  He first explained the scale at a United Nations  conference in Nineteen-
Ninety-Five in Turin, Italy. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Torino Scale is a system of numbers from zero to ten.  An asteroid is given a 
Torino number after scientists learn its size, speed and how close to Earth it will pass in 
its orbit around the Sun. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">An asteroid that is rated zero on the Torino Scale is considered to have almost no 
chance of ever hitting Earth. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">An asteroid that is a number ten on the Torino Scale is a huge object which is going 
to hit Earth.  It will cause massive damage and loss of life for most of our planet.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists say at the present time no space object they have seen has a Torino 
Scale number greater than one.  However they say this could easily change in the 
future. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">  
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There is one asteroid that could threaten Earth.  It is called Asteroid Two-
Thousand-S-G-Two-hundred-Forty-Four.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This asteroid will not come near the Earth until September twenty-first, Two-
Thousand-Thirty.  NASA experts say it has a Torino number of one now and should 
miss the Earth.  They say they will know more about this asteroid in the future as they 
continue to study its orbit.  Scientists say the object is large enough to cause severe 
local damage if it does hit the Earth. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">NASA experts say their major concern is the asteroids and comets they do not 
know about.  Learning to find and study the orbit of each new asteroid and comet is a 
difficult task.  They say they must improve their ability to find space objects to 
provide the Earth with a warning in time to take protective measures. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists have known about the threat from Near Earth Objects for many years.  
Teams of astronomers around the world are searching the sky for Near Earth 
Objects.  These teams are involved in joint projects with the United States Air 
Force, the Defense Department, NASA and several major universities.  
Recently they have begun studying several methods that would protect Earth if it were 
threatened by an object from space.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico and the Lawrence 
Livermore Laboratory in California are studying ways to destroy Near Earth Objects that 
may threaten Earth.  Methods might include firing a nuclear device into space to 
destroy the object.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some scientists say if they have the time and equipment, they could use non-
nuclear explosives to move an object out of its path.  They might be able to place a 
small rocket motor on an asteroid to change its path.  They say this could be done 
before the space rock becomes a dangerous threat.</font><p style="text-align: justify">   
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Scientists are quick to say there is no need for fear or alarm at the present time.  
However they all agree that they must prepare for what could happen in the future.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
