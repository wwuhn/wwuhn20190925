PATRIOTIC MUSIC</B></font></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><I>By Jerilyn Watson</I>
</font> </p>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Americans have always liked songs about their country. Since the terrorist 
attacks last month, they are singing these traditional patriotic songs more 
often than ever. I'm Shirley Griffith. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And I'm Sarah Long. Today we present songs that celebrate America on the VOA 
Special English program, THIS IS AMERICA. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">(("FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MAN"))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Americans will always remember the terrorist attacks on September Eleventh in 
which thousands of people were killed. Americans reacted with shock, anger and 
sadness. They also reacted by singing. Songs celebrating their country are 
helping many Americans deal with suffering and loss. People throughout the 
nation are singing these songs. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">One of the songs most often heard since the terrorist attacks is "God Bless 
America." Lawmakers have sung it at the National Cathedral, in Congress and in 
state legislatures. Children are singing it in schools. People are singing it in 
churches, synagogues, mosques and other religious centers. Twenty-thousand 
people sang "God Bless America" at a memorial service at the New York Yankees 
baseball stadium. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The great songwriter Irving Berlin wrote "God Bless America." Irving Berlin 
had come to the United States with his family from Russia when he was a small 
boy. He became very successful writing songs. He wrote "God Bless America" in 
Nineteen-Eighteen to be included in a traveling musical show. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However, Mister Berlin decided not to include the song in the show. Twenty 
years later, he looked at the song again and made some changes. The new song 
expressed his love and thanks to America for giving a poor immigrant a chance to 
succeed. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Kate Smith sang "God Bless America" for the first time on a national radio 
broadcast in Nineteen-Thirty-Eight. The public loved it. During World War Two, 
the song became especially important to Americans. Many people say it has become 
the unofficial national anthem. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Here, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sings "God Bless America."
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((TAPE CUT TWO: 
<a target="bottom" href="0002-4.htm#God bless America">GOD BLESS AMERICA</a>))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Another patriotic song is called "America." It is also known as "My Country 
T'is of Thee." Samuel Smith wrote the words in Eighteen-Thirty-Two. The music is 
the same as the British national song, "God Save the Queen." </font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A recent religious service in Britain remembered the people killed in the 
attacks in the United States. British citizens honored the dead by singing the 
American words to the song. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Here, American singer Mahalia Jackson sings "My Country T'is of Thee."
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((TAPE CUT THREE: 
<a target="bottom" href="0002-4.htm#My country">"MY COUNTRY T'IS OF THEE"</a>))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Another song that many people in the United States are singing is "America 
the Beautiful." Many famous American actors and performers sang this song during 
a national television program to raise money for victims and heroes of the 
terrorist attacks.Katherine Lee Bates wrote the words to the song in 
Eighteen-Ninety-Three. Samuel Ward wrote the music. The United States Air Force 
Band and Singing Sergeants present their version of "America the Beautiful."
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((TAPE CUT FOUR: 
<a target="bottom" href="0002-4.htm#America the beautiful">"AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL"</a>))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In Nineteen-Forty, folk singer and composer Woody Guthrie wrote the words to 
another song that celebrates America. "This Land is Your Land" has become one of 
the most popular folk songs in America. "This Land is Your Land" is not a 
religious song. Yet after September Eleventh, some Americans have sung this song 
in religious centers. Pete Seeger and the Weavers sing "This Land is Your Land."
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((TAPE CUT FIVE: 
<a target="bottom" href="0002-4.htm#This land is your land">"THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND"</a>))
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Congress made "The Star-Spangled Banner" the national song in 
Nineteen-Thirty-One. Americans sing it at the beginning of many public meetings 
and sports events. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Francis Scott Key wrote the words to the song in Eighteen-Fourteen. At that 
time, the United States and Britain were at war. Francis Scott Key watched as 
British forces attacked Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. Through the smoke 
and fire, he could see a huge American flag flying over the army base. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The next morning after the battle, he saw that the American flag still flew. 
That meant America had defeated the British. Francis Scott Key wrote a poem 
re-creating the event. Soon after, music was added to his words. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The words of "The Star-Spangled Banner" have gained new meaning since the 
terrorist attacks. The World Trade Center in New York fell soon after the 
attacks. Rescue workers found a flag in the remains of the building. They placed 
it over pieces of wreckage. This American flag marked the final resting place of 
thousands of people. Here is the Southwestern Christian College Chorus singing 
"The Star- Spangled Banner." </font>
