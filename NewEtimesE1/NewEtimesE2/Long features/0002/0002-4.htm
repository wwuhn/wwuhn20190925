<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">by Irving Berlin <br>
<br>
While the storm clouds gather far across the sea, <br>
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free, <br>
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, <br>
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
God Bless America, <br>
Land that I love. <br>
Stand beside her, and guide her <br>
Thru the night with a light from above. <br>
From the mountains, to the prairies, <br>
To the oceans, white with foam <br>
God bless America, My home sweet home. <br>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This land is your land, this land is my land, 
<br>
From California to the New York island; 
<br>
From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters, 
<br>
This land was made for you and me. 
<br>
<br>
As I was walking that ribbon of highway, 
<br>
I saw above me that endless skyway; 
<br>
I saw below me that golden valley; 
<br>
This land was made for you and me. 
<br>
(Chorus) 
<br>
I’ve roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps 
<br>
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; 
<br>
And all around me a voice was sounding: <br>
This land was made for you and me. 
<br>
(Chorus) <br>
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, 
<br>
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, 
<br>
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting: <br>
This land was made for you and me. 
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
As I went walking, I saw a sign there, 
<br>
And on the sign is said "No Trespassing." <br>
But on the other side it didn’t say nothing; <br>
That side was made for you and me. 
<br>
(Chorus) 
<br>
In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people; 
<br>
By the relief office I seen my people; 
<br>
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking, <br>
Is this land made for you and 
me? <br>
(Chorus) 
<br>
Nobody living can ever stop me, 
<br>
As I go walking that freedom highway; 
<br>
Nobody living can ever make me turn back; <br>
This land was made for you and me.

<br>
O beautiful for spacious skies<br>
For amber waves of grain<br>
For purple mountain majesties<br>
Above the fruited plain<br>
America! America!<br>
God shed His grace on thee<br>
And crown thy good with brotherhood <br>
From sea to shining sea<br>
<br>
O beautiful for pilgrim feet<br>
Whose stern, impassioned stress<br>
A thoroughfare for freedom beat<br>
Across the wilderness!<br>
America! America! <br>
God mend thine every flaw<br>
And firm thy soul in self control<br>
Thy liberty in law.<br>
<br>
O beautiful for heroes proved <br>
In liberating strife<br>
Who more than self their country loved<br>
And mercy more than life!<br>
America! America!<br>
May God thy gold refine<br>
’Til all success be nobleness<br>
And every gain divine<br>
<br>
O beautiful for patriot dream<br>
That sees beyond the years<br>
Thine alabaster cities gleam<br>
Undimmed by human tears<br>
America! America!<br>
God shed His grace on thee<br>
And crown thy good with brotherhood <br>
From sea to shining sea<br>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, <br>
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?<br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,<br>
through the perilous fight,<br>
O'er the ramparts we watched, <br>
were so gallantly streaming?<br>
And the rockets red glare,<br>
the bombs bursting in air,<br>
Gave proof through the night,<br>
That our flag was still there,<br>
<br>
Oh say, does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave,<br>
O'er the land of the free<br>
and the home of the brave.<br>
<br>
On the shore dimly seen throughout the mists of the deep<br>
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes<br>
What is that which the breeze o'er the towering steep<br>
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?<br>
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam<br>
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream.<br>
`Tis the Star-Spangled Banner, Oh long may it wave<br>
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br>
<br>
And where is that band who so hauntingly swore<br>
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion<br>
A home and country, shall leave us no more?<br>
Their blood was washed out their foul foot steps pollution<br>
No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br>
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave.<br>
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave<br>
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br>
<br>
Oh thus be it e'er when free men shall stand<br>
Between their loved homes and war's desolation!<br>
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven rescued land <br>
Praise the Pow'r that has made and preserved us a nation<br>
And conquer we must when our cause is just<br>
And this be our motto: &quot;In God is our trust.&quot;<br>
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave<br>
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br>
