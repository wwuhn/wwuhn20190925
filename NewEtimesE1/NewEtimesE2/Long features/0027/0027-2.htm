INTREPID MUSEUM</font></b></span></font></H3>
<p style="text-align: center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">By Paul Thompson

<P style="text-align: justify">　<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is Shirley Griffith.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And this is Steve Ember with the VOA Special English program 
"EXPLORATIONS." Today, we visit the Intrepid Sea-Air and Space Museum in New York 
City. It is an unusual museum that seeks to preserve old ships as an educational 
experience and as a memorial to peace. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((THEME))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A visit to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum begins with a ship that carried 
fighter planes. This aircraft carrier is the U-S-S Intrepid. The Intrepid is a 
very honored name among ships of the United States Navy. The huge aircraft 
carrier is the fourth ship to have that name. The first was a small wooden 
sailing ship that was built in Eighteen-Oh-Three. It was lost a year later in 
battle against pirates. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The U-S-S Intrepid that visitors see today in New York City sailed during 
World War Two. Few ships are as famous as the Intrepid. It was so successful in 
battles during World War Two in the Pacific Ocean that the Japanese Navy began 
calling it "The Ghost Ship." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Japanese believed they had sunk the Intrepid several different times. The 
ship may have been seriously damaged, but it always came back to fight again and 
again. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Intrepid took part in many battles. The most famous of these may have 
been the battle of Leyte Gulf, near the Philippines. It was the largest naval 
battle in history. The ship also supported the landings of Allied troops in 
their effort to free the Philippine Islands from Japanese control. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the last months of World War Two, the Japanese military attacked 
American ships by crashing airplanes into them. The Japanese pilots gave their 
lives in an effort to cause as much damage as possible. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The U-S-S Intrepid was one of the first American aircraft carriers to suffer 
this kind of an attack. On October twenty-ninth, Nineteen-Forty-Four, a Japanese 
aircraft crashed into the left side of the ship. Ten American sailors were 
killed. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That was only the first time this kind of attack would happen to the 
Intrepid. To better understand happened during these attacks, imagine for a few 
moments we are on the U-S-S Intrepid on November twenty-fifth, 
Nineteen-Forty-Four. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT ONE: MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is a bright clear day in the Phillipines. It is a little after one in the 
afternoon. High above the Intrepid, a group of several Japanese airplanes flies 
over the American force. The Intrepid's crewmembers are at their battle 
stations. They quickly begin shooting at the small Japanese planes. The crew of 
the Intrepid knows that an aircraft carrier is the first choice of the Japanese 
pilots who want to crash their planes into American ships. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">One Japanese pilot points the front of his airplane down. He increases his 
speed. He is aiming his plane at the Intrepid. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Faster and faster he dives toward the large carrier. Gunfire from the ship 
hits his airplane many times. But the pilot continues toward the carrier and his 
sure death. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">High above the ship, another Japanese pilot pushes the control that aims his 
airplane toward the large carrier. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Within five minutes, the two Japanese airplanes crash into the Intrepid. One 
explodes below the huge carrier's landing area. This area is called a hanger 
deck. It is where aircraft are kept when they are not flying. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Huge fires begin immediately. Smoke fills the sky. The ship burns for about 
six hours. Sixty-nine crew members of the Intrepid are killed. Another 
eighty-five are seriously injured. The Intrepid can no longer take part in the 
battle. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The skill and bravery of the crew saves the Intrepid. Slowly, the carrier 
leaves the battle area to return to the United States for repairs. When the 
repairs are completed, the U-S-S Intrepid and its crew return to battle again.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT TWO: MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The U-S-S Intrepid also took part in battles during the Korean War and the 
War in Vietnam. But not all of its working life was in battle. It was used in 
the American space program. It recovered some space vehicles that landed in the 
ocean after their flights into space. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Intrepid was the ship that rescued American astronaut Scott Carpenter 
after his flight in May of Nineteen-Sixty-Two. Later it was the recovery ship 
for Astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young as part of the Gemini space program.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In October, Nineteen-Seventy-Six, the Intrepid was the official Navy and 
Marine Corps ship used in cerebration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the 
United States. The ship was retired from active duty in Nineteen-Seventy-Four.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When old ships can no longer continue in active duty, they are sold for the 
metal that can be taken from them and reused. By Nineteen-Eighty, the Intrepid, 
which had such a proud past, seemed to have no future. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Then, a number of interested people formed a group called the Intrepid Museum 
Foundation. Their main goal was to save the ship and turn it into a museum. One 
member of that group became the economic force behind the effort. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That man was Zachary Fisher of New York City. Mr. Fisher spent twenty-four 
million dollars of his own money in order to save the Intrepid. He wanted to 
make the Intrepid a lasting memorial to those who gave their lives in defense of 
their country. He also wanted it made into an educational museum. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The United States Navy agreed. The Navy permanently lent the U-S-S Intrepid 
to the Museum Foundation. In August, Nineteen-Eighty-Two, the Museum opened to 
the public on the Hudson River on the west side of New York City. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The goal of the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum is to educate the public about 
the history of the Intrepid and the men who served as members of the crew. The 
museum also wants it to represent the peace that these men worked so hard to 
protect. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Later two other ships were added to the Museum's collection. They are both 
much smaller than the Intrepid. One is the a submarine, the U-S-S Growler. It 
was in active duty for only six years. The Growler is the only missile submarine 
open to the public anywhere in the world. It offers visitors a close look at 
life on a submarine. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Just behind the Growler is the U-S-S Edson. The Edson is a destroyer. It was 
built in Nineteen-Fifty-Eight. The Edson served as an active ship for more than 
thirty years. It is named for Marine Corps General Mike Edson, a hero of battles 
in the Pacific during World War Two. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Last year, about six-hundred-thousand people visited the Intrepid Sea, Air 
and Space Museum. Museum officials say that number is increasing each year.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The first thing these visitors see when they arrive at the Museum is the 
Intrepid. It is very hard to miss the huge ship. It weighs more than 
forty-thousand tons and is more than two-hundred-seventy meters long. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On the long flight deck of the carrier are airplanes. Some are very large. 
Other countries owned several of them. There is a British plane, a French plane, 
and a Russian built jet fighter that once belonged to the Polish air force.
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the most famous airplane on the Intrepid is the Lockheed A-Twelve 
Blackbird. This spy plane could fly higher and faster than any other plane. It 
could travel faster than three times the speed of sound. One of these planes 
once flew from Los Angeles, California to Washington D-C in a little more than 
one hour. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Visitors can move about the Intrepid and see how the crew lived and worked. 
They can climb the stairs to the room that controlled the ship. Many people 
bring cameras and have their picture taken with their hands on the wheel that 
was used to guide the huge aircraft carrier. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On the area called the hanger deck visitors can inspect aircraft used in 
World War Two. They can also watch movies and see how airplanes took off from 
and landed on the carrier. They can see pictures of important events in the 
history of the ship. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Very often visitors can talk to several older men who were members of the 
crew of the Intrepid. These men give freely of their time to tell the story of 
the "Ghost Ship." </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((THEME))
</font> 
<P style="text-align: justify"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">You can learn more about the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space museum and see 
pictures of its famous ships by entering the word Intrepid in a World Wide Web 
search. It is spelled ?I-N-T-R-E-P-I-D. That is I-N-T-R-E-P-I-D. </font>
