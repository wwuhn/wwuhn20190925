<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The United States has millions of unmarried adults.
Many would like go out socially and have fun with someone they like.
I'm Sarah Long. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And I'm Steve Ember.
The story of how people meet and date is our report today on the VOA Special English program, THIS IS AMERICA.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Thursday, February Fourteenth, is Valentine's Day.
On that day, many people buy cards or flowers for those who are important in their lives.
Valentine's Day gives lovers a chance to express their feelings. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However, millions of people in the United States are alone.
They are not married or involved in a close relationship.
Some of these people wish they could find someone to date.
They wish they could celebrate Valentine's Day with a special person. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There are a number of ways to find someone to date.
Some people meet at work.
Others meet by chance in a public place.
Still others visit places where other single people go.
Or they can use businesses that help organize dates.
Many men and women find dates through services they find on their personal computers.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The purpose of dating is to have fun.
Sometimes people who date develop a close relationship.
Some people decide to live together, yet remain unmarried.
Others decide to get married. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the past, young people in America usually lived with their parents until they got married.
Today, some still do.
Yet most young people live a more independent life.
They have a job.
They travel.
They rent or own their own apartment or house.
They wait longer to get married.
While waiting, they date. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Often a friend will plan a meeting between two unmarried people who do not know each other.
This is called a "blind date." The people involved are not blind.
They just have never seen each other. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However, most unmarried people have to find their own dates.
Many go to public eating, drinking or dancing places.
Every city in America has them.
Some places are popular with young people.
Others are for older people. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many Americans, however, want to go where they are sure they can meet people with similar interests.
For example, they may go to a bookstore.
Some bookstores in America now serve coffee and food.
Many offer special programs and social activities for single people.
Other singles join health clubs to exercise and to meet people.
Or, they may join groups for people who like to take long walks or watch birds.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some public eating and drinking places help plan dates for single people.
At several such places in New York City, people can write answers to a series of questions.
Then other people read the answers.
If someone likes the answers, an employee sets up a date.
This service costs a small amount of money. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A restaurant called Drip started using this system when it opened in Nineteen-Ninety-Six.
Since then, the Drip caf?has helped many people find someone to date.
It was the first restaurant and date-organizing place in a group called DateCafes.
Today more DateCafes have opened in New York and in Boston, Massachusetts.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some companies help single people meet other people.
For example, Great Expectations has been organizing dates for about twenty-five years.
It started in San Francisco, California.
The company sends millions of letters a year to people throughout the country.
The letters explain how the system works. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A company called Brief Encounters serves single people in Washington, D-C, and Baltimore, Maryland.
Its meetings provide quick introductions for ten to twelve young and middle-aged people.
At these events, people meet members of the opposite sex for only a few minutes.
A man and a woman sit at a table across from each other.
They talk for six minutes until a bell rings.
Then everyone meets a new person. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">People write their reactions on paper.
They note whom they like.
Then they give these notes to a Brief Encounters employee.
Within twenty-four hours people seeking dates receive the names and telephone numbers of those who also liked them.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The group SpeedDating also provides fast introductions.
It is one of a number of dating services organized by religious organizations.
Jewish men and women aged twenty-five to thirty-five meet for fewer than ten minutes.
Then they meet and talk to other people.
An international Jewish education center started these groups.
They began in Los Angeles, California.
The service now has spread to many American cities and to other countries.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some people seeking dates do not like making hurried choices.
But others praise this method.
A young woman in Chicago, Illinois says it prevents spending long hours with someone who is not very interesting.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many American newspapers and magazines publish messages from people seeking someone to date.
The messages are called "personal want ads" or simply "personals."
This is the usual kind of message in a personal ad: "Nice looking woman, forty years old, thin, athletic, successful, great cook, desires long-term relationship."
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Men who want to meet this woman write to the newspaper or magazine.
They describe themselves and their interests.
The woman reads the letters.
Then she decides if she wants to meet any of the men. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There also are telephone dating services in many cities.
A person calls a telephone dating service and leaves a message on a recording machine.
For example, a man describes himself and the kind of woman he hopes to meet.
He describes what kind of relationship he would like. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Other people call and listen to the messages.
If they hear one they like, they leave their own message.
If two people enjoy these telephone messages, they can make plans to meet.
Some telephone services let people speak directly to others they might want to date.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((MUSIC BRIDGE)) </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Millions of Americans seek someone to date through services they find through their personal computers.
People start by communicating with strangers.
Sometimes the strangers become friends.
They might decide to meet.
Then they might decide to date.
They may even decide to get married. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A business called Match-dot-Com is a leader in organizing dates through the World Wide Web.
It has more than two-and-one-half-million members. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Members can get lists of people their age who live nearby.
Some people identify themselves, while others do not.
Many send pictures electronically.
The goal is for people to get to know each other through electronic mail.
Then, they can decide to meet and date.
Match-dot-com says its listings have led to more than one-thousand-four-hundred weddings.
Many other members have formed close relationships. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">However, many people believe there is the possibility of danger in any situation when strangers meet.
Some women say they do not want to meet a man through a computer dating service.
They are afraid that a man may not be the kind of person he claims to be. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Some people praise businesses that help organize dates.
Others say they wish they could meet people by chance.
No one method of finding someone to date works for everyone.
When single people finally get together, what do they do on a date?</font><P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">People of all ages like to do many of the same things.
They go to restaurants or night clubs.
They go to movies, museums and concerts.
They watch sporting events.
Sometimes, they decide to spend the rest of their lives together. </font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A clothing designer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was married a few weeks ago.
Her new husband is an engineer.
They found each other through their personal computers.
They tried this service because neither had much chance to meet someone at work.
</font>
<P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For several years after they finished their university studies, both felt alone.
Now these newly married people say that this year, they are truly celebrating Valentine's Day.
</font>
