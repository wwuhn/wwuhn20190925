<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is Steve Ember. And this is Bob Doughty with the VOA Special English program EXPLORATIONS.  
Today, we tell about how people learned an important piece of information necessary 
for safely sailing on the oceans.  It is called longitude.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
      
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">On a foggy October night in Seventeen-Oh-Seven, four English (1) navy ships hit 
rocks in the Atlantic Ocean and sank.  Two-thousand men drowned.  The ships 
had been sailing in the thick fog for twelve days.  There was no sure way to know 
where they were.  The commander of the ships had been worried that they could hit 
rocks if they were not careful.  He asked his&nbsp; navigators for their opinion 
       on their location in the ocean.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The navigators did not really know.  They told the commander they thought 
they were west of a small island near the coast of northwestern France.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">They were wrong.  Instead, they sailed onto rocks near a small group of 
islands southwest of England's Atlantic coast.  The navigators' lack of knowledge led 
to the loss of four ships and two-thousand lives.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">When people began sailing out of sight of land, sailors did not know how to 
tell where they were on the open sea.  Land travelers can look at a mountain, a river, 
or an object that shows them where they are in relation to where they came from.  
On the ocean, however, there is no sign to tell a sailor where he is.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The most important device for knowing directions on the ocean is a  compass.  A compass is a  device containing a metal object that points toward the 
magnetic north pole.  This shows navigators the direction of north, and therefore 
also south, east, and west.  But sailors need more information to sail safely on the 
open sea.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
     
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Most maps of the world show lines that are not on the Earth's surface.  One 
line is the equator.  It is an  imaginary line around the widest part of the Earth. 
There are similar lines both north and south of the  equator.  These circles become 
smaller and smaller toward the north pole and the south pole.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">These lines, or circles, are  parallel - meaning that they are equally distant 
from each other at any point around the world.  These lines show what is called  latitude.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A navigator can know the latitude of his ship by observing the location of stars, 
where the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening, and what time of year it is.  
With this information he knows where his ship is in relation to the north or south pole 
and the equator. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
      
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Still, there is one more important piece of information necessary for safely 
sailing the oceans. For many centuries, scientists,  astronomers and inventors 
searched for a way to tell longitude.  The lines of  longitude go the other way 
from latitude lines.  They stretch from the north pole to the south pole, and back 
again in great circles of the same size. All of the lines of longitude meet at the top 
and bottom of the world.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In her book, Longitude, writer Dava Sobel tells the story about longitude and 
how the problem of knowing it was solved.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For centuries, the great scientists of the world struggled to develop a way to 
learn longitude.  To learn longitude at any place requires knowledge about time.  A 
navigator needs to know what time it is on his ship and also the time at another place 
of known longitude - at the very same moment.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Earth takes twenty-four hours to complete one full turn or  revolution 
of three-hundred-sixty degrees. One hour marks one twenty-fourth of a turn, or fifteen 
degrees.  So each hour's time difference between the ship and the starting point 
marks a ship's progress of fifteen degrees of longitude to the east or west. Those 
fifteen degrees of longitude mark a distance traveled.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">At the equator, where the Earth is widest, fifteen degrees  stretches about 
one-thousand-six-hundred kilometers.  North or south of that line, however, the 
distance value of each degree  decreases.  One degree of longitude equals four 
minutes of time all around the world.  But in measuring distance, one degree  shrinks
 from about one-hundred-nine kilometers at the Equator to nothing at the north 
and south poles.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
      
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For many centuries, navigators hoped they could find longitude by observing the 
movement of stars at night. During the day, the sun provided information about the 
time on a ship, and its direction.  However, it did not provide necessary information 
about the time somewhere else.</font><p style="text-align: justify">       
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the Sixteenth century, one astronomer 
suggested that navigators could observe the moon as it passed in front of different 
known stars to tell longitude. But, there was not enough information about the stars to 
use this method&nbsp; effectively.  Astronomers could not tell exactly where the moon 
would be from one night or day to the next. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Yet it seemed to those seeking to solve the longitude problem that the only 
solution was in the moon and stars.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">During the Seventeenth Century, English astronomers began a major effort to 
map the stars and their relationship to the moon as it passed across the sky. Royal 
Astronomer John Flamsteed worked at this task for forty years. The next Royal 
Astronomer, Edmund Halley, spent another forty years gathering information about the 
moon's  orbit.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">After many years of gathering the necessary information, it became possible to 
learn longitude by observing the stars and the moon.  In Seventeen-Sixty- Six, Royal 
Astronomer Nevil Maskelyne published the  Nautical Almanac and Astronomical 
Ephemeris.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It contained all the necessary information about the moon and stars that 
sailors would need to help them learn their longitude.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This new method was not simple.  A navigator had to use complex observing 
 
instruments to note the position of the moon and stars.  Then he had to seek the 
correct information in the Nautical Almanac about the moon and stars at that time of 
night or day.  The final step in the process was to take the mathematical information 
from the book, link it to the current information and solve the resulting problem.  
This took an average of four hours to do. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">     
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">While scientists were studying the stars and moon to solve the longitude 
problem, a man named John Harrison was working on another project.  He was trying 
to build a clock that would help sailors learn longitude. His task also was difficult and 
complex.  Mister Harrison had to develop a clock that was not affected by the 
movement of a ship on the ocean or changes in temperature or  atmospheric 
pressure.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">He began developing his clock in Seventeen-Thirty.  It took five years to 
complete.  The complex device weighed thirty-four kilograms.  Several years later, 
Mister Harrison built a second clock.  It was smaller, but weighed more than the first.  
Mister Harrison was not satisfied and began work on another device.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Twenty years, later he completed a device that was smaller than the first two, 
and weighed less.  But, still Mister Harrison was not satisfied. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Two years later, in Seventeen-Fifty-Seven, he produced a small clock that he 
could hold in his hand.  The clock could tell the correct time in two places, meeting 
the requirements for learning longitude on the sea. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
       
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For many years after Mister Harrison's work was completed, the idea of using a 
clock to learn longitude was rejected. However, that opinion changed when  manufacturers learned how to make better and less costly versions of Mister 
Harrison's clocks.  The clocks became known as chronometers.  By Eighteen- 
Fifteen, five-thousand chronometers were in use on ships sailing the world's oceans.  
The complex documents and mathematical work were no longer necessary.  Almost 
any sailor could tell what his longitude was by simply looking at a clock.  The world 
had changed.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
       
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">John Harrison's clocks can be seen today at the Old Royal Observatory in 
 
Greenwich, England.  The first three are still operating, showing the correct time. 
To look at them is to see the simple solution to a problem that worried people for 
many centuries. Today, the solution to the problem is so common that it is difficult to 
understand that there was a problem at all. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
