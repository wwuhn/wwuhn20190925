<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE:</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">April is National  Poetry Month. People are celebrating poetry in the 
United States, around the world and even in space. I'm Shirley Griffith.
VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And I'm Sarah Long. We tell about National Poetry Month and the great American 
poet Walt Whitman on our report today on the VOA Special English program, THIS IS 
AMERICA. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((THEME)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">America's National Poetry Month has become a worldwide event. Millions of 
people are taking part in poetry activities this month. People are reading poems in more 
than one- hundred cities around the world. They are presenting poems in Antarctica and 
on Mount Everest. Astronauts are reading poems on the International Space Station. 
The&nbsp; Academy of American Poets organized this worldwide National Poetry 
Month celebration. The academy was&nbsp; established in Nineteen-Thirty-Four to support 
poets and their work. It started the first National Poetry Month in Nineteen-Ninety-Six. 
The goal was to help more Americans add poetry to their lives. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the Nineteenth Century, one of America's greatest writers, Walt Whitman, 
helped people learn to value poetry. Whitman created a new kind of poetry. People 
across the nation are&nbsp; honoring Whitman with readings of his work during National 
Poetry Month. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Walt Whitman was born in Eighteen-Nineteen in New York City. During his long life, 
he watched America grow from a new nation to the strongest industrial power in the 
world. Whitman was influenced by events around him. But his poetry speaks of the 
inner self. He celebrated great people like President Abraham Lincoln. He also 
celebrated common people. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">As a young man, Whitman worked as a schoolteacher, a printer and a newspaper 
reporter. He was thirty-six years old when he published his first book of poetry in 
Eighteen-Fifty-Five. He called it "Leaves of Grass." It had only twelve poems. The poems 
are written in free verse. The lines do not follow any set form. Some lines are short. 
Some are long. The words at the end of each line do not have a similar sound. They do 
not rhyme. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Here are some lines from the famous poem "Song of Myself" from "Leaves of 
Grass." Whitman writes about grass as a sign of  everlasting life.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE THREE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A child said, what is the grass? Fetching it to me with full hands;<br> 
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.<br>
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green&nbsp; stuff woven.<br> 
Or I guess it is the&nbsp; handkerchief of the Lord, <br>
A scented gift and remembrance designedly dropped, <br>
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see and 
remark, and say whose? <br>
¡­And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves,<br> 
Tenderly will I use you curling grass? <br>
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men¡­ <br>
¡­It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their 
mother's laps.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">One of America's greatest thinkers and writers immediately recognized the 
importance of "Leaves of Grass." Ralph Waldo Emerson praised Whitman's work. But 
most other poets and writers said nothing or denounced it. 
Most readers also rejected Whitman's poems. The new form of his poetry surprised 
many people. His praise of the human body and sexual love shocked many people. 
Whitman was homosexual. He loved other men. Some people disliked Whitman's 
opinions of society. He rejected the search for money and power. 
Even his own brother told Whitman that he should stop writing poetry. But Whitman 
had many things to say. And he continued to say them. Readers began to understand 
that America had a great new poetic voice. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((BRIDGE MUSIC)) </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The American Civil War began in Eighteen-Si|ty-One. The southern states had 
broken away from the United States. They wanted to protect their rights against the 
central government. They especially wanted to continue owning black slaves. 
The northern states fought the South to save the Union and free the slaves. Walt 
Whitman hated slavery because he believed all people are equal. He supported the 
northern cause. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the war Whitman worked for the government in Washington, D.C. He also 
worked without pay at army hospitals. He helped care for wounded and dying soldiers. 
He sat beside these men for hours. He wrote letters for them. He brought them food and 
money. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Whitman sometimes saw President Abraham Lincoln riding his horse in 
Washington. President Lincoln was murdered soon after the Civil War ended. Whitman 
honored him with a poem called "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed." The 
poem describes Lincoln as a great spirit and a fallen star. This is how the poem begins:
</font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE THREE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">When lilacs last in the dooryard&nbsp; bloomed, <br>
And the great star early drooped in the western sky in the night, <br>
I mourned, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring. <br>
Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring, </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE THREE (CONT): </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Lilac blooming perennial and&nbsp; drooping star in the west, <br>
And thought of him I love. <br>
O powerful western fallen star! </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">After the Civil War, Whitman worked for government agencies. He watched the 
United States try to heal itself and increase democracy. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">To Walt Whitman, democracy was more than a political system or idea. It was the 
natural form of government for free people. Whitman believed democracy is meant to 
honor the rights of every person and the equality of all people. Whitman&nbsp; denounced 
people who believed they were better than others in the eyes of God. He expresses 
these ideas in his poem "Song of Myself." </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE THREE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I think I could turn and live with animals; they are so placid and self-contained, <br>
I stand and look at them long and long. <br>
They do not sweet and whine about their condition, <br>
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins, <br>
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God, <br>
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is&nbsp; demented with the mania of owning things, <br>
Not one kneels to another, or to his kind that lived thousands of years ago, <br>
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((MUSIC BRIDGE))</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE ONE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Experts today praise "Leaves of Grass" as a major literary work. In his time, 
Whitman thought of it as a work in progress. He re-published the book every few years 
for the rest of his life. Each time he added new poems. And he changed many of the old 
lines. The last version of the book contained more than four- hundred poems. By then, 
Whitman's fame had spread to many nations.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Eighteen-Seventy-Three, Walt Whitman suffered a stroke. He spent the last 
years of his life in Camden, New Jersey. He wrote more poems. He also wrote about 
political and democratic policies. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Whitman was poor and weak during the last years of his life. He died in Eighteen-
Ninety-Two. But if we can believe his poetry, death held no terrors for him. Listen to 
these lines from "Song of Myself": </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE THREE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me¡­ <br>
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me¡­ <br>
And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths. <br>
(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before)¡­ <br>
Do you see O my brothers and sisters? <br>
It is not chaos or death -- it is form, union, plan -- it is eternal life -- it is Happiness¡­ <br>
I depart as air; I shake my white locks at the runaway sun¡­ <br>
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, <br>
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles. <br>
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean, <br>
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless¡­ <br>
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, <br>
Missing me one place search another, <br>
I stop somewhere waiting for you. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE TWO: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Some critics say Walt Whitman was a spokesman for democracy. Others say he 
was not a spokesman for anything. Instead, they simply call him a great poet. We leave 
you now with more words from "Song of Myself" by Walt Whitman. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">VOICE THREE: </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul, I am the poet of the woman 
the same as the man <br>
