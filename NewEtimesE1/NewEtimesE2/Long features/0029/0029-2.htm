<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">And this is Steve Ember with the VOA Special English program EXPLORATIONS. 
Today, we tell about efforts to climb the highest mountain in the world, Mount 
Everest. And we tell about the first blind person to do so. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">More than eight-hundred people have successfully climbed the world's highest 
mountain, Mount Everest. It is at the border of Nepal and Tibet. One in about 
every five of those who have stood on the mountain top did not survive the trip 
down. Many others died before reaching the eight-thousand-eight-hundred-fifty 
meter summit. They all battled freezing temperatures. Winds up to 
one-hundred-sixty- kilometers per hour. Dangerous mountain paths. And they all 
risked developing a serious illness caused by lack of oxygen. All for the chance 
to reach the top of the world. </font>  <p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The first and most famous of the climbers to disappear on Mount Everest was 
George Mallory. The British school teacher was a member of the first three trips 
by foreigners to the mountain. In Nineteen-Twenty-One, Mallory was part of the 
team sent by the British Royal Geographical Society and the British Alpine Club. 
The team was to create the first map of the area and find a possible path to the 
top of the great mountain. They found a possible path from the northeast side of 
the mountain. Mallory also was a member of the first Everest climbing attempt in 
Nineteen- Twenty-Two. But the attempt was canceled after a storm caused a giant 
mass of snow to slide down the mountain, killing seven native ethnic Sherpa 
guides. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mallory was invited back to Everest as lead climber of another expedition in 
Nineteen-Twenty-Four. On June fourth, Mallory and team member Andrew Irvine left 
their base camp for the team's final attempt to reach the mountain top. The 
climbing team had great hopes of success for the two men. A few days earlier, 
expedition leader Edward Norton had reached a record height of 
eight-thousand-five-hundred-seventy- three meters before he turned back. He knew 
it was too late in the day for him to climb to the summit and return to base 
camp before dark. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Mallory and Irvine were using bottled oxygen. Mallory believed that was the only 
way they would have the energy and speed to climb the last three-hundred meters 
to the top and return safely. Team member Noel Odell saw Mallory and Irvine 
climbing high on the mountain the following day. He said they had just climbed 
one of the most difficult rocks on the northeast path. He said they were moving 
toward the top when clouds hid them. He never saw them again. The disappearance 
of Mallory and Irvine on Mount Everest remains among the greatest exploration 
mysteries of the century. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the next twenty-nine years, teams from Britain made seven more attempts 
to climb Everest. Until the early Nineteen-Fifties, teams from Britain were the 
only foreign climbers given permission to climb Mount Everest. On May 
twenty-ninth, Nineteen-Fifty-Three, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the 
first climbers known to reach the summit of Everest. The two were part of a 
British team lead by Jon Hunt. They had made a difficult climb from the 
southeast, through recently-opened Nepalese territory. Edmund Hillary was a 
bee-keeper from New Zealand. It was his second trip to Everest. He had been on 
the first exploratory trip to the mountain that had mapped the way up from the 
southern side. Tenzing Norgay was a native Nepalese Sherpa. He was the first 
Sherpa to become interested in mountain climbing. His climb with Hillary was his 
seventh attempt to reach the top. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hillary said that his first reaction on reaching the top of Mount Everest was a 
happy feeling that he had &quot;no more steps to cut.&quot; The two men planted a stick 
holding the flags of Britain, Nepal, India and the United Nations. Hillary took 
a picture of Norgay. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">They looked out over the north side into Tibet for any signs that Mallory or 
Irvine had been there before them. Then they began the long and difficult trip 
back down. The success of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay led to many new 
attempts on the mountain. Today, Everest has been climbed from all of its sides 
and from most of its possible paths. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Reinhold Messner of Italy and Peter Habeler of Austria made another historic 
Everest climb in Nineteen-Seventy-Eight. The two men were the first to reach the 
summit without using bottled oxygen.</font><p style="text-align: justify">  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Messner said when he reached the top he felt like a single giant lung. At the 
time, scientists believed that a person at the top of the mountain would only 
have enough oxygen to sleep. </font> <p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Scientists believed that Messner and Habeler would die without oxygen. 
Scientists now know that two conditions make climbing at heights over 
eight-thousand meters extremely difficult. The first is the lack of oxygen in 
the extremely thin air. The second is the low barometric air pressure. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Today, scientists say a person lowered onto the top of the mountain would live 
no more than ten minutes. Climbers survive in this so-called &quot;death zone&quot; above 
eight- thousand meters because they spend several months climbing to higher 
points on the mountain to get used to the conditions.</font><p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Several things have made climbing Everest today easier than for the first 
climbers. These include modern equipment and clothing. They also include 
information gained from earlier climbs and scientific studies.</font><p style="text-align: justify">  
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Ninety-Three, a record one-hundred-twenty-nine people climbed Mount 
Everest. Many were inexperienced climbers. In recent years, some expert climbers 
have begun leading guided trips up the mountain. Some people have paid as much 
as sixty-five-thousand dollars for the chance to climb Everest. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Ninety-Six, Everest had its greatest tragedy. A record ten people 
died on the mountain in one day. Two of the world's best climbers were among 
those killed. Three guided groups were trying to reach the summit of the 
mountain that day. Several books by climbers have described the incident and the 
dangerous mountain conditions. The best known is &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;by Jon Krakauer. 
The book became an international best seller and increased the interest in 
climbing Mount Everest. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In Nineteen-Ninety-Nine, an American group of climbers went to Everest. They 
tried to find out if George Mallory and Andrew Irvine should be included among 
those who have succeeded in climbing Mount Everest. The Mallory and Irvine 
Research team had information they thought would lead them to Irvine's body. 
Instead, they found the body of Mallory. The climbers said the evidence they 
discovered did not solve the mystery of whether Mallory and Irvine reached the 
summit. The climbers said the evidence shows only that Mallory died in a fall 
while climbing down the mountain. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Climbing to the top of Mount Everest is a major victory for any person, but 
imagine if the climber could not see. Last month, the first blind man 
successfully reached the top of Everest. Erik Weihenmayer (WINE-may-er) is a 
thirty-two-year-old American. He climbed to the summit with the help of his 
team. Each member of the team wore bells on his clothes for Weihenmayer to hear. 
They also called out warnings to help him cross dangerous areas. It took the 
group more than two months to reach the summit. The National Federation of the 
Blind helped pay for the climb. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Weihenmayer already had climbed several of the world's tallest mountains. He 
says he often told himself that he could not fail to reach the top of Everest. 
Failing would confirm that mountain climbing is a sport only for people who can 
see. Historians may consider this the most successful climb of Mount Everest in 
history, and not just because of Weihenmayer. A record nineteen climbers from 
his team reached the summit. So did the oldest man ever to climb Mount Everest. 
He is sixty- four-year-old Sherman Bull. </font>
