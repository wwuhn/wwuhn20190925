      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">And I'm Rich Kleinfeldt with the special English program, people in America.  
Today, we begin the story of twentieth century poet Robert Frost.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">(Theme)</font><P style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In 1961, John Kennedy was sworn in as president of the United States.  He 
asked one of America's best-known writers to read a poem.  Robert Frost stood in the 
cold sunlight that day, his white hair blowing in the wind.  He read these words 
from his poem, "the gift outright":</font><P style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The land was ours before we were the land's. She was our land more than a 
hundred years before we were her people.  She was ours in Massachusetts, in Virginia, 
but we were England's, still colonials, possessing what we still were unprocessed by, 
possessed by what we now no more possessed. Something we were withholding 
made us weak until we found out that it was ourselves we were withholding from our land 
of living, and forthwith found salvation in surrender. Such as we were we gave 
ourselves outright (the deed of gift was many deeds of war) to the land vaguely 
realizing westward, but still unstoried, artless, unenhanced, such as she was, such 
as she would become.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music Bridge))</font><P style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Robert Frost was one of America's best-known and most honored serious writers.  
But his fame came late in his life.  He was forty years old before Americans began to 
read his poems and praise them.  Once his fame was established, however, it grew 
stronger and stronger during the rest of his long life.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">His success came from uniting traditional forms of poetry with American 
words, spoken in a clearly American way.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Frost used the same speaker for many poems, so the separate poems formed 
a larger unity.  He created this speaker carefully.  He felt that his readers would believe 
his poems if he put the words into the mouth of a wise person who lived in the country, 
not the city.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many people thought the speaker was frost himself.  In fact, the speaker was an 
imaginary person.  Frost, the man, tried to become the imeginary person he 
created for his poetry.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Robert Frost is always linked to the land of cold winters in the northeastern 
United States, the area called New England. Yet he came from the other side of the 
country, San Francisco, California. He was born there in eighteen- seventy- four. He 
lived in California during his early childhood. </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify">      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This man who was born in the west 
and became linked with New England was named for the chief southern general in 
America's civil war.  The general's name was Robert Edward lee.  The poet was 
named Robert lee frost, because his father wanted to honor the general.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Someone once asked another American writer, Ernest Hemingway, how to 
become a writer.  The best thing, he said, was to have an unhappy childhood.  If 
this is true, Robert frost's childhood was unhappy enough to make him a very good writer.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music Bridge))</font><P style="text-align: justify">
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Robert Frost's father was a reporter who wanted to be a politician.  He 
often drank too much alcohol and became angry. Robert was the victim of his anger.  
He was eleven when his father died.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">His mother tried to protect him from his father's anger.  Some people think she 
protected him too much.  As a child, Robert was afraid of the dark.  All his life he 
suffered from imaginary sicknesses.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Frost's mother was from New England.  After her husband died, she moved back 
there.  She supported her children by teaching school. Yet she got more enjoyment 
from reading and writing poetry.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Frost finished high school in eighteen- ninety- one.  He and a girl, Elinor White, 
had the best record of the students graduating that year.  He married Elinor three 
years later.  She rejected him at first, but finally agreed to marry him.  This rejection led 
to a lack of trust in their marriage.  It made Frost say this, "I could lose everything and 
not be surprised." </font> <P style="text-align: justify">      
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">After high school, Frost's grandfather offered to pay his costs at Dartmouth 
college.  Frost left the school after a few months. He did not like it.  He spent the next 
few years working at different jobs.  At one time, he worked in a factory.  Later, he 
repaired shoes.  He was a teacher.  He was a reporter.  Always, he wrote poetry.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Frost attended Harvard University for two years.  After that, he returned to the 
many jobs he held before.  And he continued to write poetry.  He said that until 
nineteen-thirteen, he earned only about ten dollars a year from writing.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For a while, Frost tried to take care of a farm in the state of New Hampshire.  
He was not a successful farmer.  During this time of working and traveling from job to 
job, he and his wife had four children.  Since he earned very little money, his family was 
always poor.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Robert Frost saw himself becoming more and more like his father, treating his 
family badly.  He became very unhappy with himself and with his life.  He even thought 
about ending his life.  In nineteen-twelve, he decided to try to make a new start. He took 
his family to Britain.  The cost of living was low.  And there was an interest in what was 
then called a "new poetry."</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In Britain, Frost found a publisher for his first book of poems. The book was 
called, a boy's will.  When it appeared in nineteen-thirteen, Frost received high praise 
from British readers.  Praise was something he had not received in his own country.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Ezra pound, another American poet living in Britain, read the poems and liked 
them very much.  He wrote a magazine report about frost.  He also helped get 
Frost's second book of poems published in America.  That book was called, North of 
Boston.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many readers consider north of Boston to be Frost's best book of poems.  In 
Britain, it was praised even more than his first book. Readers saw the way he took 
simple material and constructed from it a world of new meanings.  They saw the way he 
spoke with a voice that sounded like common speech.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">What they failed to see was the differences Frost found between what was seen 
and the person doing the seeing.  This was what he called "the outer and inner 
weather."</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In nineteen-fifteen, both of frost's books were published in the United States.  
He felt that his books had "gone home," and he should go home, too.  When he 
reached America, he was surprised by the praise he received and the acceptance of 
American publishers.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the words of the poem he read at president Kennedy's inauguration many 
years later:  the land was his before he was the land.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
       <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">((Music Bridge))</font><P style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">When Robert Frost returned to America from Britain, he bought another farm in 
New Hampshire. To feed himself and his family, he depended on the sales of his books 
and papers. He also earned money by speaking at universities.       Success did not 
ease his life.  And it did not change the way he thought and acted. The gentle, wise 
person who spoke from his poems was the man frost wanted to be.  He knew, however 
-- and his family knew -- he was not that man.       Tragic events affected him. His son 
killed himself. His wife was often sick, and his daughter became mentally sick. Frost, 
too, suffered from his own imaginary sicknesses. Through his poems, however, he lived 
a different life.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Frost was a worker in words, a craftsman.  He tried to capture exactly the 
speech of the people of New England.  He used simple descriptions that were easily 
understood.  He talked about simple, natural things:  trees, the weather, the seasons, 
night and day.  In an early poem he wrote: </font> 
<P style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I'm going out to clean the pasture spring; I'll only stop to rake the leaves 
away (and wait to watch the water clear, I may): I shouldn't be gone long. --You come too. 
I'm going out to fetch the little calf that's standing by the mother.  It's so young it totters 
when she licks it with her tongue. I shouldn't be gone long. --You come too.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
     <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Robert frost said that reading his poems should begin with pleasure and end in (30) 
wisdom.  Yet as he grew older, his simple idea of the world became more difficult.  His 
world was more touched with sadness.  He wrote more about fear, about being alone, 
about losing whatever he had.</font><P style="text-align: justify">
