<br>
More than four-million Americans get married each year. Some of these people 
will have a traditional wedding&nbsp; ceremony in a religious center, a hotel or 
a social club. These couples may invite hundreds of people to their 
celebrations. Other couples will have a simple ceremony performed by a judge in 
a public building. They will invite only close family members and friends. They 
may not have the money to spend on a big wedding. Or they may want to save money 
for a wedding trip to a faraway place or to help them buy a house. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Americans get married in different ways. But the meaning of all these weddings 
is the same. The bride and groom promise to spend the rest of their lives 
together. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>
Big weddings have created a huge business in the United States. A big wedding 
requires special clothing, flowers, food preparation, photographs and music. 
Experts say the average American wedding costs about twenty-thousand dollars. 
Some estimates say Americans spend as much as seventy-thousand-million dollars a 
year for everything connected with weddings. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Traditionally, the bride's parents plan and pay for the wedding. Sometimes the&nbsp; 
groom 's parents share this responsibility. Today many Americans are older when 
they get married. So they often organize and pay for their own weddings. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>
For example, a businessman and a nurse in Boston, Massachusetts will marry later 
this month. They will have a traditional American church wedding. The bride will 
wear a long white dress and a white head covering called a veil. She also will 
wear four other traditional things: Something old. Something new. Something 
borrowed. And something blue. These four things are supposed to bring her good 
luck. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">During the ceremony she and her groom will accept each other as husband and 
wife. They will promise to love and honor each other always. The groom will 
place a gold wedding ring on the third finger of the bride's left hand. The 
bride will place a gold wedding ring on the third finger of the groom's left 
hand. The&nbsp; clergy member performing the ceremony will declare that they are 
husband and wife. Then the bride and groom will kiss. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<br>
In the past few months the couple agreed about all the plans for their wedding 
except the music. The groom wanted a friend to play a string instrument called a 
banjo during the ceremony. The bride wanted a friend to play a string instrument 
called a harp. Now they have compromised. They agreed that another friend will 
sing one of the most popular songs heard at American weddings. Celine Dion sings 
this song, &quot;My Heart Will Go On.&quot; </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">((CUT TWO: MY HEART WILL GO ON)) <br>
<br>
Couples planning their weddings can get wedding advice from married friends. 
They can study magazines published especially for people getting married. They 
can pay a professional wedding planner to help organize the ceremony and party. 
And they can also use the Internet computer system to plan their wedding. 
&quot;Modern Bride&quot; magazine says more than one-million couples buy wedding products 
and services on the Internet. The bride and groom can communicate with family 
members and friends who will take part in the celebration. They can look at 
pictures of clothes they may wear during the ceremony. They can choose flowers. 
They can decide where to hold the wedding party, and what food and drink will be 
served. They can study where to take a wedding trip. They can buy tickets for 
transportation and hotels. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>
Some couples also establish their own Web sites. This way, they can provide 
needed information to people invited to the wedding from distant places. For 
example, two-hundred people were invited to a recent wedding in Chicago, 
Illinois. The couple had the ceremony in a church near the bride's home. But 
more than half of those who attended lived far from Chicago. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The wedding couple's Web site advised these guests about places to stay and 
things to do in the city. It provided maps showing how to reach the church and 
the club where the wedding dinner would be served. The bride said she saved time 
and money by not having to mail this information to the guests. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><br> 
Wedding guests traditionally give a gift to the bride and groom. Computer 
technology also is making it easier for guests to find the perfect gift. 
Sometimes guests can do this without leaving home. </font> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">For example, a couple can go to a store and choose gifts they would like to 
receive. These include things for their home like dishes and cooking equipment. 
The store can print a list of all these things. This list also can be found on 
the Internet. Guests can buy a gift at the store or on the Internet. </font>  
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>
Sometimes the bride and groom give gifts to their guests. These gifts may be 
baskets filled with candy and small bottles of wine. Or the baskets may contain 
objects that will help guests remember the wedding celebration. For example, a 
bride from South Carolina loves to play tennis. Her gift baskets included tennis 
balls printed with the couple's names and the date of their wedding.</font><p style="text-align: justify">
 
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Another bride and groom were married in a hotel garden. The ceremony took place 
on a hot spring day. Guests received gifts of hats to protect them from the sun.</font><p style="text-align: justify">

<br>
Experts say about half of American weddings this year will not be costly or 
require months of planning. Melinda Reed is a clergywoman at a Protestant church 
in Bethesda, Maryland. Reverend Reed says many couples today choose simple, 
nontraditional weddings. This is especially true of older people who have been 
married before. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">She recently performed a nontraditional wedding for an older couple. Their 
wedding ceremony was held in the garden of a private home. The couple had a 
total of ten children from their earlier marriages. Their many grandchildren all 
took part in their ceremony. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Reverend Reed also performed a nontraditional wedding ceremony for a bride and 
groom who were more than eighty years old. They were married quietly in an 
office in the church. But later, the couple danced at a big party for family and 
friends. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>
Couples can have simple wedding ceremonies almost anywhere. Some people have 
their weddings on a beautiful beach or in a wooded area. Others marry in the 
home of a friend. Friends and family members help prepare the wedding meal. A 
couple in Washington, D-C was married almost thirty years ago in a public park. 
Now their twenty-seven-year-old son is planning to marry this year. He says he 
and his bride will be married in the same park. </font>   
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> <br>
Earlier this month, Reverend Reed performed a wedding at a famous monument in 
Washington. The couple had received permission to marry at the Jefferson 
Memorial. This circular white memorial contains a statue of Thomas Jefferson, 
the third president of the United States. </font> <p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Visitors to the memorial gathered nearby to watch and listen. The statue of 
President Jefferson watched over the wedding couple as they promised to live 
together for the rest of their lives. </font>   <p style="text-align: justify">
