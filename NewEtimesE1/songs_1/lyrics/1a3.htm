&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#000080">&nbsp;<font size="4">Goodbye to you, my trusted friend. We've 
known each other since we were nine or ten. Together we've climbed hills and 
trees, learned of love and ABC's, skinned our hearts and skinned our knees. 
Goodbye, my friend. It's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky. 
Now that spring is in the air, pretty girls are everywhere. Think of me and I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun, but the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me. I was the black sheep of the family. You 
tried to teach me right from wrong. Too much wine and too much song. Wonder how 
I got along. Goodbye, papa. It's hard to die when all the birds are singing in 
the sky. Now that the spring is in the air, little children everywhere. When you 
see them, I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun, but the wine and the song, like the seasons, have all gone. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye, Michelle, my little one. You gave me love and helped me find the sun. And every time that I was down, you would always come around, and get my feet back on the ground. Goodbye, Michele. It's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky Now that spring is in the air, with the flowers everywhere, I wish that we could both be there. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun, but the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach. All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun, but the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time.</font></font></P><H1 align=left>　</H1>
