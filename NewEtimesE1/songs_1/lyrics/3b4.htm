<P class=left style="line-height: 200%">

<font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4">&nbsp;I don't know how to love him, what to do, 
how to move him? I've been changed, yes, really changed. In these past few days when I see myself, I seem like someone else. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how to take this. I don't see why he moves me. He's a man, he's 
just a man, and I've had so many men before. In very many ways, he's just one more. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I bring him down? Should I scream and shout? Should I speak of love, let my feelings out? I never thought I'd come to this. What's it all about? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you think it's rather funny-I should be in this position? I'm the one who has always been so calm, so cool, no lover's fool. Running every show, he scares me so. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, if he said he loved me, I'd be lost, I'd be frightened. I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope. I'd turn my head, I'd back away. I wouldn't want him to know; he scares me so. I want him so. I love him so.</font></font></P>
